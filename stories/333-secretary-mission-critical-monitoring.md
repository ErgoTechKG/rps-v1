# Story 333: Secretary Mission-Critical Monitoring Control Center

## Title
Secretary Mission-Critical Monitoring Control Center with Real-Time Alerts

## Role
Secretary

## Category
System Monitoring

## Priority
High

## Description
Implement a mission-critical monitoring control center designed for 24/7 operational oversight, featuring real-time data streams, predictive alerts, visual status indicators, and emergency response coordination. The interface adopts a control room aesthetic with dark themes and high-contrast data visualization.

## User Story
As a secretary (科研秘书), I want a mission-critical monitoring control center so that I can oversee all system operations in real-time, detect issues before they become problems, and coordinate emergency responses effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Control Center Interface Design
- [ ] Dark theme control room aesthetic (#1A202C background, #2D3748 cards)
- [ ] Four-zone layout: status bar, real-time data, task monitoring, alerts
- [ ] Large screen optimization with high-contrast data visualization
- [ ] Status bar showing current date/time and quick action buttons
- [ ] Full-screen mode for dedicated monitoring displays

### Real-Time Data Monitoring
- [ ] Live data counters with trend indicators:
  - Active users (156 with upward trend arrow)
  - Active courses (8 with stable indicator)
  - Pending reviews (12 with attention marker)
  - New additions (7 with highlight)
- [ ] Color-coded status indicators (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Auto-refresh every 30 seconds without user interaction

### Task Monitoring Dashboard
- [ ] Real-time task status distribution:
  - Pending tasks with count and priority
  - In-progress tasks with progress indicators
  - Overdue tasks with urgent warnings
  - Completed tasks with success confirmations
- [ ] Visual task flow representation
- [ ] Click-through to detailed task management

### Predictive Alert System
- [ ] Scrolling alert panel with severity levels:
  - Critical alerts (red) for immediate attention
  - Warning alerts (orange) for upcoming issues
  - Info alerts (yellow) for general notifications
- [ ] Alert categorization and filtering
- [ ] One-click alert resolution actions
- [ ] Alert acknowledgment and escalation system

### Course Progress Visualization
- [ ] Dual-progress comparison charts:
  - Lab rotation course progress (phases: application, matching, learning, outcomes)
  - Comprehensive evaluation progress (phases: preparation, submission, review, publication)
- [ ] Color-coded progress bars with percentage completion
- [ ] Visual indicators for behind-schedule phases
- [ ] Drill-down capability to detailed course metrics

### Emergency Response Coordination
- [ ] Quick action buttons for common emergency responses
- [ ] Escalation protocols with automated notifications
- [ ] Contact directory for key personnel
- [ ] Incident logging and tracking system
- [ ] Emergency communication broadcast capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Real-time dashboard with WebSocket connections
- High-performance charting libraries for live data
- Dark theme with accessibility considerations
- Responsive design for large displays and tablets

### Backend
- Real-time data aggregation from all system components
- Predictive analytics engine for proactive alerts
- WebSocket server for live data streaming
- Alert management and escalation system

### Database
- Time-series data storage for trends and analytics
- Alert configuration and history tables
- Incident tracking and response logs
- System health and performance metrics

### Performance
- Real-time updates with minimal latency (<1 second)
