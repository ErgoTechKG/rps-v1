# Story 202: Professor Resource Version Control System

## Overview

As a professor, I need a comprehensive version control system for course resources that allows me to track changes, maintain historical versions, collaborate with colleagues, and ensure students always have access to the most current materials while preserving the ability to rollback when needed.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As a professor**, I want to track all changes made to course materials so I can maintain a complete history of content evolution and understand what changed when.

2. **As a professor**, I want to create and manage different versions of course resources so I can test new content while keeping proven materials as backup.

3. **As a professor**, I want to collaborate with other professors on shared resources while maintaining clear authorship and change tracking.

4. **As a professor**, I want to automatically backup and sync my course materials so I never lose important content due to technical issues.

### Secondary User Stories

5. **As a professor**, I want to compare different versions of the same resource to understand what changes were made and why.

6. **As a professor**, I want to rollback to previous versions of materials when updates don't work as expected.

7. **As a professor**, I want to branch and merge content for different course sections or semesters while maintaining a master version.

8. **As a professor**, I want to receive notifications when shared resources are updated by collaborators.
