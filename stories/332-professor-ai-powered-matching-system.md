# Story 332: Professor AI-Powered Student Matching System

## Title
Professor AI-Powered Student Matching System with Visual Interface

## Role
Professor

## Category
Student Selection

## Priority
High

## Description
Implement an intelligent student matching system that uses AI algorithms to recommend optimal student-project pairings based on academic performance, research interests, practical experience, and time availability. The system features an intuitive visual interface with adjustable matching criteria and detailed explanations.

## User Story
As a professor, I want an AI-powered student matching system with visual controls so that I can efficiently identify the best students for my research projects based on multiple criteria and receive explanations for the recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AI Matching Interface
- [ ] Project selection dropdown for choosing the research topic
- [ ] Matching parameter selector with preset options (default recommendation, custom weighting)
- [ ] Visual weight adjustment sliders for matching criteria:
  - Academic performance (GPA and ranking) - default 80%
  - Research interests (field alignment) - default 60%
  - Practical experience (projects and competitions) - default 50%
  - Time availability (weekly commitment) - default 30%
- [ ] Real-time matching score recalculation when weights are adjusted

### Student Recommendation Display
- [ ] Ranked list of students with matching percentages (0-100%)
- [ ] Student cards showing:
  - Profile photo and basic information
  - Overall matching score with color coding (green >90%, yellow 70-89%, red <70%)
  - Key strengths and weaknesses with icon indicators
  - Quick action buttons (view details, select)
- [ ] Detailed matching factor explanations:
  - Positive factors (green indicators)
  - Neutral factors (yellow indicators)  
  - Negative factors (red indicators)

### Matching Criteria Configuration
- [ ] Adjustable weight sliders with percentage display
- [ ] Automatic normalization ensuring weights sum to 100%
- [ ] Preset configurations (balanced, academic-focused, experience-focused)
- [ ] Save custom configurations for future use
- [ ] Reset to default settings option

### Matching Explanation System
- [ ] Detailed breakdown of how each student's score was calculated
- [ ] Factor-by-factor analysis with numerical contributions
- [ ] Comparison view showing why one student ranked higher than another
- [ ] Historical matching success tracking for algorithm improvement
- [ ] Ability to provide feedback on matching quality

### Integration and Data Management
- [ ] Real-time access to student academic records and profiles
- [ ] Integration with course application data
- [ ] Machine learning model that improves over time based on professor feedback
- [ ] Export functionality for matching results and analysis

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Interactive slider components for weight adjustment
- Real-time score updates using computed properties
- Card-based layout for student recommendations
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Backend
- Machine learning algorithm for student-project matching
- Real-time scoring calculation API
- Student data aggregation from multiple sources
- Feedback collection system for algorithm improvement

### Database
- Student profile and performance data
- Project requirements and criteria
- Historical matching decisions and outcomes
- Professor feedback and satisfaction ratings

### Performance
- Matching calculations complete within 3 seconds
- Smooth slider interactions without lag
- Efficient data loading for large student populations
- Caching for frequently accessed matching results
