# Story 131: Student Smart Interview Scheduling System

## Overview
As a student, I want to use an intelligent interview scheduling system that allows me to easily book, reschedule, and manage interview appointments with professors during the application process, so that I can efficiently coordinate my interview schedule without conflicts.

## User Story
**As a** student applying for lab rotation courses
**I want** a smart interview scheduling system
**So that** I can easily book interview slots, avoid scheduling conflicts, and receive automated reminders

## Background
From the student-ui.md design (lines 230-237), students need a sophisticated interview booking system during the application process. The current basic systems don't provide the intelligent features described in the UI design for conflict detection, automated reminders, and flexible rescheduling.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Smart Calendar Interface
- **Given** I am on the interview booking page
- **When** I view available time slots
- **Then** I should see a calendar view with:
  - Available 30-minute time slots in green
  - Unavailable slots in gray
  - My existing commitments highlighted
  - Professor's blocked times shown

### 2. Intelligent Conflict Detection
- **Given** I am selecting an interview time
- **When** I choose a slot that conflicts with my schedule
- **Then** the system should:
  - Automatically detect schedule conflicts
  - Show warning message with conflict details
  - Suggest alternative nearby time slots
  - Allow me to proceed with confirmation if needed

### 3. Multi-Format Interview Support
- **Given** I am booking an interview
- **When** I select interview format
- **Then** I should be able to choose:
  - Online interview (with automatic meeting link generation)
  - In-person interview (with location details)
  - Hybrid option if available
  - Special accessibility accommodations

### 4. Automated Reminders and Notifications
- **Given** I have confirmed an interview appointment
- **When** the interview time approaches
- **Then** I should receive:
  - Email reminder 24 hours before
  - System notification 2 hours before
  - SMS reminder 30 minutes before (if enabled)
  - Meeting link/location details in each reminder

### 5. Flexible Rescheduling System
- **Given** I need to change my interview time
- **When** I request to reschedule
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - View professor's updated availability
  - Select new time slot with one click
  - Send automated rescheduling request to professor
  - Receive confirmation of the change

### 6. Interview Preparation Hub
- **Given** I have an upcoming interview
- **When** I access the interview details
- **Then** I should see:
  - Interview preparation checklist
  - Professor's interview style preferences
  - Suggested questions to prepare
  - Document upload for interview materials

### 7. Multi-Interview Coordination
- **Given** I am applying to multiple professors
- **When** I manage multiple interview appointments
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - View all interviews in unified calendar
  - Avoid double-booking across different applications
  - Batch reschedule if needed
  - Track interview outcomes and feedback

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Real-time availability synchronization
- Automated email/SMS notification system
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Meeting link generation for online interviews

### UI Components
- Interactive calendar widget with drag-and-drop
- Time zone handling for remote interviews
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go scheduling
- Interview type selection interface
- Reminder preference settings

### Data Model
```
InterviewSlot {
  id, studentId, professorId, courseId,
  startTime, endTime, format, location,
  meetingLink, status, remindersSent,
  preparationMaterials, notes
}
```

## Dependencies

## Priority
High - Critical for improving the student application experience and reducing scheduling friction

## Notes
- Should integrate with existing application workflows
- Needs to handle different time zones for remote interviews
- Should support accessibility requirements
- Could include AI-powered optimal scheduling suggestions
