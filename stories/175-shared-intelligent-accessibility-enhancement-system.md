- [ ] I can switch to high contrast modes with customizable color schemes
- [ ] I can activate screen reader optimization with semantic markup enhancement
- [ ] I can use voice navigation and voice input throughout the platform
- [ ] I can enable simplified navigation modes for cognitive accessibility

### Intelligent Personalization
- [ ] I can receive AI-powered accessibility recommendations based on my usage patterns
- [ ] I can save and sync accessibility preferences across devices
- [ ] I can use machine learning-enhanced voice recognition for improved accuracy
- [ ] I can access predictive text and smart autocomplete for form filling
- [ ] I can utilize gesture-based navigation for motor accessibility

### Universal Design Features
- [ ] I can navigate the entire platform using only keyboard input
- [ ] I can access all functionality through alternative input methods
- [ ] I can receive multimedia content in multiple accessible formats
- [ ] I can use the platform effectively in low-bandwidth conditions
- [ ] I can access emergency features through multiple communication channels

### Assistive Technology Integration
- [ ] I can seamlessly integrate with third-party assistive technologies
- [ ] I can use advanced screen readers with full semantic support
- [ ] I can connect external accessibility devices and hardware
- [ ] I can access real-time captioning for video content
- [ ] I can utilize eye-tracking and switch-based navigation systems

### Accessibility Analytics and Improvement
