# User Stories Index - Research Management Platform

This document provides a comprehensive index of all user stories organized by implementation priority and dependency order.

## Project Overview

This is a role-based research management platform for a university with four distinct user types:
- **Professor (教授)** - Course management, student selection, grading
- **Student (学生)** - Course enrollment, task completion, submissions  
- **Secretary (科研秘书)** - System administration, data collection, monitoring
- **Leader (领导)** - Strategic oversight, data analysis, decision support

## Story Statistics

- **Total Stories**: 48
- **Foundation Stories**: 7 (14.6%)
- **Lab Rotation Stories**: 15 (31.3%)
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Stories**: 13 (27.1%)
- **Role-Specific Features**: 7 (14.6%)
- **System Administration**: 6 (12.5%)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Foundation Phase** must be completed first as all other features depend on authentication, navigation, and basic user management.

2. **Lab Rotation and Comprehensive Evaluation** can be developed in parallel after foundation, as they represent independent course types.

3. **AI Features** should be implemented after core workflows are stable, as they enhance existing functionality.

4. **System Administration** features can be developed throughout the project as needed for operational requirements.

5. **Integration with External Systems** should be planned early but implemented last to ensure stable internal systems before external dependencies.

## Route Coverage

All stories align with the routing structure defined in DESIGN.md:
- `/professor/*` - 8 stories
- `/student/*` - 11 stories  
- `/secretary/*` - 13 stories
- `/leader/*` - 9 stories
- `/shared/*` - 7 stories

This ensures complete coverage of the planned application architecture and user workflows.
