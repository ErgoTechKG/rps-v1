## Implementation Notes

1. **Foundation Phase** must be completed first as all other features depend on authentication, navigation, and basic user management.

2. **Lab Rotation and Comprehensive Evaluation** can be developed in parallel after foundation, as they represent independent course types.

3. **AI Features** should be implemented after core workflows are stable, as they enhance existing functionality.

4. **System Administration** features can be developed throughout the project as needed for operational requirements.

5. **Integration with External Systems** should be planned early but implemented last to ensure stable internal systems before external dependencies.
