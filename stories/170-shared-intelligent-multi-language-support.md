## Story
**As a** platform user from any role  
**I want** intelligent multi-language support that adapts to my language preferences and provides seamless translation capabilities  
**So that** I can use the platform effectively in my preferred language while maintaining full functionality and contextual accuracy

## Background
The shared UI design emphasizes Chinese-first interface design but also includes considerations for multi-language support and accessibility. This story captures the need for an intelligent language system that goes beyond basic translation to provide contextually aware, role-specific language support.
