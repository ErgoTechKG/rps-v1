# Story 164: Leader Strategic Risk Assessment Platform

## Story Statement
As a **Leader**, I want to **have a strategic risk assessment platform that identifies, analyzes, and models institutional risks across all operational areas**, so that **I can make informed decisions about risk mitigation and ensure long-term institutional sustainability and success**.

## Feature Details

### Comprehensive Risk Detection
- **Multi-Domain Risk Analysis**: Academic, financial, operational, reputational, and regulatory risk assessment
- **Early Warning Systems**: Predictive models that identify emerging risks before they materialize
- **External Risk Monitoring**: Integration with external data sources for market and regulatory risks
- **Scenario Modeling**: What-if analysis for different risk scenarios and their potential impacts
- **Risk Interconnection Mapping**: Analysis of how different risks may amplify each other

### Strategic Risk Management
- **Risk Prioritization Matrix**: Automated ranking of risks by probability and impact
- **Mitigation Strategy Planning**: AI-powered recommendations for risk mitigation approaches
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Economic modeling of risk mitigation strategies
- **Resource Allocation Optimization**: Optimal allocation of resources for risk management
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of risk levels and mitigation effectiveness
