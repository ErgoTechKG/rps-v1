# Story 472: Professor Visual Matching Matrix Interface

## Description
As a Professor working with the Secretary, I need a visual 2D matrix interface that displays professor-student matching relationships in a grid format with color-coded status indicators, interactive conflict detection, and the ability to make adjustments to optimize the matching process.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Matrix Grid Display**
   - Professors on Y-axis, Students on X-axis (or configurable)
   - Cell color coding: green (matched), yellow (potential), red (conflict), gray (unavailable)
   - Hover tooltips showing matching details
   - Zoom and pan for large matrices
   - Sticky headers for easy navigation

2. **Interactive Matching**
   - Click cells to toggle matching status
   - Drag to select multiple cells
   - Right-click context menu for actions
   - Keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
   - Undo/redo functionality

3. **Conflict Detection**
   - Real-time conflict highlighting
   - Visual indicators for capacity exceeded
   - Time conflict detection
   - Preference mismatch warnings
   - Suggested resolution options

4. **Smart Features**
   - AI-powered optimal matching suggestions
   - Load balancing visualization
   - Preference score heat overlay
   - Success probability indicators
   - Historical matching data reference

5. **Filtering and Views**
   - Filter by research area, availability
   - Show only conflicts view
   - Compact/expanded cell views
   - Export matrix as image/Excel
   - Save custom view configurations

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React with Canvas/SVG for rendering
- Efficient rendering for large matrices (100+ students)
- WebGL for smooth zooming/panning
- State management for complex interactions
- Real-time sync for collaborative matching

## Dependencies
- Story 009: Professor Student Selection Process
- Story 017: Secretary Participant Management
- Story 037: Professor AI Student Matching
- Story 091: Secretary Intelligent Matching System

Reference: secretary-ui.md lines 253-258 - 2D grid showing professor-student matching with color-coded status

## Notes
- This is a shared tool between professors and secretaries
- Consider accessibility for color-blind users (patterns/symbols)
- Performance is critical for large cohorts
- Include batch operations for efficiency
- Consider split-screen view for comparing scenarios
