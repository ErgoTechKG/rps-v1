# Story 245: Leader Multi-dimensional Risk Assessment System

## Description
As a leader, I want a comprehensive multi-dimensional risk assessment system that evaluates institutional risks across multiple categories and provides predictive risk modeling so that I can proactively identify, assess, and mitigate potential threats to institutional objectives and operational continuity.

## User Story
```
As a leader
I want a multi-dimensional risk assessment system with predictive modeling
So that I can proactively identify and mitigate institutional risks before they impact operations
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Risk Category Framework
- [ ] Define risk categories: Financial, Academic, Operational, Compliance, Reputation, Technology
- [ ] Establish risk probability scales (1-5: Very Low to Very High)
- [ ] Set impact severity levels (1-5: Minimal to Catastrophic)
- [ ] Create risk appetite thresholds for each category
- [ ] Implement risk interconnection mapping

### Risk Identification and Assessment
- [ ] Automated risk scanning from data sources and external feeds
- [ ] Manual risk reporting submission from departments
- [ ] Risk probability calculation using historical data
- [ ] Impact assessment with quantified financial implications
- [ ] Risk velocity measurement (how quickly risks could materialize)

### Predictive Risk Modeling
- [ ] Machine learning algorithms for risk trend prediction
- [ ] Early warning indicators for emerging risks
- [ ] Scenario-based risk simulation capabilities
- [ ] Risk correlation analysis across different dimensions
- [ ] Predictive timeline for risk materialization

### Risk Visualization Dashboard
- [ ] Heat map visualization showing risk intensity by category
- [ ] Risk matrix plotting probability vs. impact
- [ ] Trend lines showing risk level changes over time
- [ ] Geographic risk mapping for location-based risks
- [ ] Executive summary with top 10 risks requiring attention

### Risk Mitigation Planning
- [ ] Automated mitigation strategy recommendations
- [ ] Risk treatment plan templates and workflows
- [ ] Mitigation cost-benefit analysis
- [ ] Risk transfer and insurance recommendation engine
- [ ] Contingency plan development and testing schedules

### Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Real-time risk level monitoring
- [ ] Automated alerts when risk thresholds are exceeded
- [ ] Risk appetite deviation notifications
- [ ] Regulatory compliance risk tracking
- [ ] Crisis escalation protocols and communication plans

## Technical Requirements
- Integration with external risk intelligence feeds
- Real-time data processing capabilities
- Secure risk data storage with encryption
- Mobile alerts for critical risk escalations
- API connectivity for third-party risk management tools

## Dependencies
- Story 020: Leader Executive Overview
- Story 164: Leader Strategic Risk Assessment Platform
- Story 047: Advanced Analytics and Reporting
- Story 080: Leader Predictive Analytics System

## Business Value
- Reduces institutional risk exposure by 40-50%
- Enables proactive vs. reactive risk management
- Improves regulatory compliance and audit readiness
- Minimizes crisis response time and impact
- Enhances institutional resilience and continuity planning

## UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive color-coded risk heat maps
- Mobile-responsive design for emergency access
- Drill-down capabilities from high-level to detailed views
- Export functionality for board and regulatory reporting
- Collaborative risk assessment interfaces for team input

## Acceptance Definition
The story is complete when leaders can access comprehensive risk assessments across multiple dimensions, view predictive risk models with early warning indicators, implement automated mitigation recommendations, and monitor institutional risk levels in real-time with appropriate escalation protocols.
