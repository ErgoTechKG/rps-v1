# Story 359: Student Interactive Learning Timeline Navigator

## Title
Interactive Visual Learning Timeline with Milestone Tracking

## Description
As a Student, I need an interactive visual timeline that displays my learning journey with milestone tracking, progress visualization, and adaptive guidance to help me understand my academic progress and plan my path forward effectively.

## Actors
- Student (Primary)
- Academic Advisor
- Professor
- AI Learning Assistant

## Preconditions
- Student is enrolled in courses
- Learning milestones are defined
- Progress data is available
- Timeline framework is configured

## Postconditions
- Learning progress is visualized
- Milestones are tracked and updated
- Adaptive guidance is provided
- Student engagement improves

## Normal Flow
1. Student accesses Learning Timeline Navigator
2. System displays interactive timeline:
   - Past achievements (completed)
   - Current position (in progress)
   - Future milestones (upcoming)
   - Optional paths (available)
3. Timeline shows multiple views:
   - Semester view
   - Course view
   - Skill development view
   - Career path view
4. Student interacts with timeline elements:
   - Hover for quick details
   - Click for expanded information
   - Drag to explore scenarios
   - Zoom for different time scales
5. Milestone markers indicate:
   - Assignment deadlines
   - Exam dates
   - Project submissions
   - Achievement unlocks
6. Progress visualization shows:
   - Completion percentages
   - Skill progression bars
   - Performance trends
   - Comparative analytics
7. AI provides adaptive guidance:
   - Suggested next steps
   - Optimal path recommendations
   - Risk warnings
   - Encouragement messages
8. Student plans future activities
9. Timeline updates dynamically
10. Progress is saved automatically

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: What-If Scenario Planning
1. At step 4, Student enters planning mode
2. System enables scenario simulation
3. Student adjusts course selections
4. Timeline shows impact preview
5. AI calculates new projections
6. Student compares scenarios
7. Optimal path is recommended
8. Flow continues from step 8

### Alternative Flow 2: Collaborative Planning
1. At step 8, Student requests advisor input
2. System shares timeline with advisor
3. Advisor suggests modifications
4. Real-time collaboration enabled
5. Changes reflected immediately
6. Joint planning session recorded
7. Flow continues from step 9

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: Missing Prerequisites
1. At step 7, system detects prerequisite gaps
2. Timeline highlights conflicts
3. Alternative paths suggested
4. Registration barriers shown
5. Student adjusts plans
6. System validates new path

### Exception 2: At-Risk Detection
1. At step 6, performance trends show risk
2. System triggers early warning
3. Support resources highlighted
4. Intervention options presented
5. Student acknowledges alerts
6. Support team notified

## Business Rules
- Timeline must reflect real-time data
- Milestones cannot be modified by students
- Progress calculations must be transparent
- Privacy settings control sharing
- Adaptive guidance must be personalized

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Timeline renders in < 2 seconds
- Smooth animations at 60 fps
- Touch-enabled for mobile devices
- Accessible via keyboard navigation
- Offline mode with sync capability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive timeline responds to user input
- [ ] Multiple view modes function correctly
- [ ] Progress calculations are accurate
- [ ] Milestone tracking updates in real-time
- [ ] AI guidance is relevant and helpful
- [ ] Scenario planning produces valid results
- [ ] Mobile experience is optimized

## Technical Notes
- D3.js or similar for timeline visualization
- Canvas/WebGL for smooth animations
- Machine learning for path optimization
- Progressive web app capabilities
- Local storage for offline access

## UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive gesture controls
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent color coding
- Smooth transitions between views
- Contextual help tooltips
- Print-friendly timeline export

## Dependencies
- Stories: 014, 028, 070, 005
- Learning management system
- Analytics engine
- AI recommendation service
- Calendar integration

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Information overload overwhelms students
  - **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure and filtering
- **Risk**: Inaccurate predictions discourage students
  - **Mitigation**: Confidence intervals and disclaimers
- **Risk**: Technical complexity barriers
  - **Mitigation**: Guided tutorials and simple mode

## Assumptions
- Students want visual progress tracking
- Historical data is accurate
- Milestones are well-defined
- Students have consistent internet access
