# Story 454: Leader Visual Course Architecture Designer

## Role
Leader

## Feature
Visual Course Architecture Designer

## Description
As a Leader, I want a visual course design system with drag-and-drop functionality, tree structures, node manipulation, and relationship mapping, so that I can design and visualize complex course architectures and their interdependencies intuitively.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Visual Design Canvas
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive course component placement
- **Tree Structure Visualization**: Hierarchical course organization
- **Node Types**: Different visual representations for courses, modules, units
- **Zoom and Pan**: Navigate large course architectures easily

### 2. Course Components
- **Course Nodes**: Create and configure course elements
- **Module Organization**: Group related learning units
- **Prerequisites**: Define and visualize course dependencies
- **Learning Paths**: Design sequential and parallel paths

### 3. Relationship Mapping
- **Dependency Lines**: Visual connections between courses
- **Prerequisite Chains**: Highlight required course sequences
- **Cross-References**: Show related but non-dependent courses
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify scheduling or prerequisite conflicts

### 4. Interactive Features
- **Node Properties**: Click to edit course details
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and modify multiple courses
- **Templates**: Save and reuse common course structures
- **Validation**: Real-time checking of architecture integrity

### 5. Collaboration and Export
- **Team Editing**: Multiple users can work on designs
- **Comments**: Add notes to specific courses or connections
- **Export Options**: Generate reports, diagrams, course catalogs
- **Version Control**: Track changes to course architectures

## Technical Notes
- Canvas rendering library (e.g., D3.js, Cytoscape.js)
- Graph data structure for course relationships
- Real-time collaboration framework
- SVG/Canvas for high-performance rendering
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, PNG, JSON)
