# Story 156: Professor Intelligent Task Automation System

## Story Statement
As a **Professor**, I want to **use an intelligent task automation system that handles routine administrative tasks**, so that **I can focus more time on teaching and research while maintaining high efficiency in course management**.

## Feature Details

### Task Automation Dashboard
- **Automated Grading Pipeline**: Set up rules for auto-grading assignments based on criteria
- **Batch Operations**: Perform bulk actions on multiple students/assignments simultaneously 
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: AI-powered meeting scheduling that avoids conflicts
- **Automated Reminders**: Smart reminder system for deadlines and important events
- **Task Templates**: Pre-configured task templates for common activities

### Smart Workflow Engine
- **Process Automation**: Automate repetitive workflows like grade recording and notification sending
- **Conditional Logic**: Set up if-then rules for different scenarios
- **Integration Hub**: Connect with external tools and systems
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track automation effectiveness and time savings

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task Automation Interface
- [ ] Professor can access automation dashboard from main navigation
- [ ] System provides visual workflow builder for creating automation rules
- [ ] Professor can set up automated grading rules with customizable criteria
- [ ] Batch operation tools are available for common tasks (grading, messaging, status updates)
- [ ] Intelligent scheduling suggests optimal meeting times based on availability

### Automation Management
- [ ] Professor can enable/disable specific automation rules
- [ ] System provides audit trail of automated actions
- [ ] Professor can customize automation parameters and thresholds
- [ ] Error handling and fallback procedures are in place for failed automations
- [ ] Progress tracking and status updates for long-running automated tasks

### Performance Analytics
- [ ] Dashboard shows time savings from automation
- [ ] System tracks automation success rates and identifies improvement opportunities
- [ ] Professor receives weekly reports on automation effectiveness
- [ ] Performance comparison shows before/after automation metrics

## Technical Considerations

### Backend Requirements
- **Workflow Engine**: Implement robust workflow automation engine
- **Rule Processing**: System for evaluating and executing conditional logic
- **Background Jobs**: Queue system for handling automated tasks
- **API Integration**: Support for connecting external tools and services

### Data Management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all automated actions
- **Version Control**: Track changes to automation rules and configurations
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure data integrity across automated operations
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to undo automated actions if needed

## UI/UX Requirements

### Interface Design
- **Drag-and-Drop Builder**: Visual workflow creation interface
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of automation effects
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback on automation status
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simplified interface that reveals complexity as needed

### User Experience
- **Onboarding Wizard**: Guided setup for first-time automation users
- **Template Gallery**: Pre-built automation templates for common scenarios
- **Context-Sensitive Help**: Inline help and documentation
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Key automation controls available on mobile devices

## Dependencies
- Story 010: Professor Process Management (core workflow foundation)
- Story 036: Professor AI Homework Detection (AI capabilities)
- Story 004: Notification System (automated messaging)
- Story 047: Advanced Analytics and Reporting (performance tracking)

## Success Metrics
- **Time Savings**: 30% reduction in administrative task time
- **Error Reduction**: 50% fewer manual errors in routine tasks
- **User Adoption**: 80% of professors actively use at least one automation
- **Satisfaction Score**: 4.5+ rating on automation usefulness survey

## Priority
High - Addresses key pain point of professor time management and efficiency

## Estimated Effort
Large (8-12 weeks) - Complex workflow engine and AI integration required
