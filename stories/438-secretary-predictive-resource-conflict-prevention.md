## Title
Secretary Predictive Resource Conflict Prevention

## Role
Secretary

## Description
As a secretary, I need a predictive resource conflict prevention system that uses AI to anticipate scheduling conflicts, resource allocation issues, and operational bottlenecks before they occur, automatically suggesting solutions and implementing preventive measures.

## Background
The UI design specifications (secretary-ui.md lines 769-796) describe an advanced AI-powered system that analyzes usage patterns, predicts potential conflicts, and proactively prevents issues in resource allocation and scheduling across the institution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Predictive Analytics Engine
- [ ] Analyze historical usage patterns to predict future resource demands
- [ ] Identify potential scheduling conflicts 2-4 weeks in advance
- [ ] Predict equipment maintenance needs and potential failures
- [ ] Forecast space utilization and capacity constraints

### Conflict Detection and Prevention
- [ ] Monitor real-time resource allocation and usage
- [ ] Detect emerging conflicts in scheduling and resource assignment
- [ ] Identify cascading effects of scheduling changes
- [ ] Predict impact of special events and high-demand periods

### Automated Resolution Suggestions
- [ ] Generate alternative scheduling options for detected conflicts
- [ ] Suggest optimal resource reallocation strategies
- [ ] Recommend preventive maintenance schedules
- [ ] Propose capacity expansion or optimization measures

### Proactive Intervention System
- [ ] Automatically implement pre-approved conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Send early warning notifications to affected stakeholders
- [ ] Trigger preventive actions based on prediction confidence levels
- [ ] Escalate critical conflicts requiring human intervention

### Analytics and Reporting
- [ ] Provide dashboards showing conflict prediction accuracy and trends
- [ ] Generate reports on prevented conflicts and their potential impact
- [ ] Track system effectiveness and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Support continuous improvement of prediction algorithms

## Technical Notes

### Architecture
- Machine learning pipeline for pattern analysis and prediction
- Real-time event processing for conflict detection
- Rules engine for automated intervention strategies
- Integration layer for institutional resource management systems

### Integration Requirements
- Calendar and scheduling system APIs
- Facility and equipment management systems
- Human resources and staffing platforms
- Event management and booking systems

### Performance Requirements
- Process predictions and updates within 5 minutes
- Support real-time monitoring of thousands of resources
- Maintain prediction accuracy >80% for 2-week forecasts
- Handle concurrent conflict resolution for multiple resource types
