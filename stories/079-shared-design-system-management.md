# Story 079: Shared Design System Management

## User Story
As a **system administrator**, I want to manage the shared design system components and style guide so that all users experience consistent visual design and interaction patterns across the platform.

## Background
The shared UI design file defines a comprehensive design system with colors, typography, spacing, and component specifications. This story ensures these design standards are properly implemented and maintained as a living system.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Design Token Management
- [ ] Color palette tokens are centrally managed and consistent across all interfaces
- [ ] Typography scales and font families are properly implemented
- [ ] Spacing and grid systems follow the 8px baseline
- [ ] Component styles maintain consistency with design specifications

### Component Library
- [ ] All basic components (buttons, forms, cards) follow shared design specifications
- [ ] Complex components (navigation, tables, modals) maintain visual consistency
- [ ] Component states (hover, active, disabled) are properly defined
- [ ] Component documentation is available and up-to-date

### Theme Customization
- [ ] Role-based color themes are properly implemented
- [ ] Dark/light mode support is available
- [ ] Accessibility standards are maintained across all themes
- [ ] Theme switching is smooth and consistent

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Design system violations are automatically detected
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility is ensured
- [ ] Responsive design standards are maintained
- [ ] Performance impact of design system is optimized

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details
- Implement design tokens using CSS custom properties or styled-system
- Create component library with consistent API patterns
- Build design system documentation site
- Set up automated visual regression testing

### Security Considerations
- Ensure design system doesn't expose sensitive information
- Validate that custom themes don't break security boundaries
- Implement proper Content Security Policy for design assets

### Performance Requirements
- Design system CSS should load in under 100ms
- Component library should not exceed 200KB gzipped
- Theme switching should complete in under 50ms

## Dependencies
- Story 001: User Authentication (for role-based themes)
- Story 003: Shared Navigation System (for consistent navigation styling)

## Mockups/Wireframes
Reference: ui-ux/shared-ui.md comprehensive design system specifications

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Design system is fully implemented across all interfaces
- [ ] All four role-based themes work correctly
- [ ] Design system documentation is complete
- [ ] Automated testing validates design consistency
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met
- [ ] Accessibility standards are verified
