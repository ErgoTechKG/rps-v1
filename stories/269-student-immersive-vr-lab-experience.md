# Story 269: Student Immersive VR Lab Experience

## Description
As a Student, I want to access virtual reality laboratory experiences so that I can conduct experiments and practice procedures in a safe, immersive environment without physical lab constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- VR-compatible lab simulations for various subjects
- Hand tracking for natural interaction with virtual equipment
- Multi-user collaborative VR sessions
- Recording and playback of VR lab sessions
- Assessment integration for VR-based evaluations
- Safety tutorial and orientation module
- Progress tracking across VR experiments
- Fallback to 3D desktop mode for non-VR users

## Dependencies
- Story 074: Professor Laboratory Resource Management
- Story 234: Student Virtual Reality Lab Platform
- Story 070: Student Learning Path Management

## Technical Notes
- Support for major VR headsets (Quest, Vive, etc.)
- Implement physics simulation for realistic interactions
- Create optimized 3D models for smooth performance
- Design accessible UI for VR environment
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility
