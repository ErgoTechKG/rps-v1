# Story 158: Secretary Comprehensive Crisis Management System

## Story Statement
As a **Secretary**, I want to **have a comprehensive crisis management system that can detect, escalate, and coordinate responses to academic emergencies**, so that **I can ensure continuity of educational operations and protect student and faculty interests during critical situations**.

## Feature Details

### Crisis Detection Engine
- **Multi-Source Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of academic, technical, and administrative systems
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI-powered detection of anomalous patterns that may indicate crises
- **Early Warning System**: Graduated alerts for potential issues before they become critical
- **External Integration**: Connection to emergency services and institutional alert systems
- **Scenario Modeling**: Pre-defined crisis scenarios with automated response protocols

### Response Coordination Platform
- **Emergency Communication**: Mass notification system with multi-channel delivery
- **Resource Mobilization**: Automatic allocation and tracking of emergency resources
- **Stakeholder Coordination**: Centralized communication hub for crisis team members
- **Documentation System**: Real-time logging of crisis events and response actions
- **Recovery Planning**: Structured approach to post-crisis assessment and recovery

## Acceptance Criteria

### Crisis Detection
