# Story 392: Professor Real-Time Student Progress Monitoring

## Description

As a professor, I want a real-time dashboard that monitors all my students' progress simultaneously during active learning sessions, so that I can provide immediate intervention and support when needed.

## User Story

**As a** professor  
**I want** real-time monitoring of all student progress during active learning  
**So that** I can identify students who need help immediately and provide timely intervention

## Acceptance Criteria

### Real-Time Progress Dashboard
- [ ] Live view of all students' current activities and progress status
- [ ] Color-coded indicators for student engagement levels (active, struggling, idle)
- [ ] Real-time completion percentage for ongoing assignments and activities
- [ ] Alert system for students falling behind or showing signs of difficulty
- [ ] Time-on-task tracking for each student and activity

### Interactive Monitoring Tools

- [ ] One-click messaging system to send encouragement or guidance
- [ ] Ability to push additional resources to students who need help
- [ ] Group formation tools for peer assistance based on progress data
- [ ] Quick intervention tools (hints, extensions, simplified versions)

### Analytics and Insights
- [ ] Predictive indicators for students at risk of falling behind
- [ ] Learning pattern analysis showing optimal study times and methods
- [ ] Comparative progress visualization across all students
- [ ] Bottleneck identification in course materials or assignments
- [ ] Engagement heatmaps showing when students are most/least active

### Communication Integration
- [ ] Integrated chat system for immediate student support
- [ ] Automated notification system for concerning progress patterns
- [ ] Screen sharing capability for one-on-one assistance
