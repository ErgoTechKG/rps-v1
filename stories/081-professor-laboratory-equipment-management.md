# Story 081: Professor Laboratory Equipment Management

## User Story
As a **professor**, I want to manage laboratory equipment, booking, and resource allocation so that I can ensure students have access to necessary equipment for their research projects.

## Background
The professor UI design includes resource management capabilities that extend beyond basic materials to include physical laboratory equipment, booking systems, and resource coordination with other faculty members.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Equipment Inventory Management
- [ ] View complete inventory of available laboratory equipment
- [ ] Track equipment status (available, in use, maintenance, broken)
- [ ] Monitor equipment location and current assignments
- [ ] Access equipment specifications and operating manuals

### Booking and Reservation System
- [ ] Reserve equipment for specific time slots
- [ ] View equipment availability calendars
- [ ] Set up recurring reservations for course requirements
- [ ] Receive notifications for booking confirmations and changes

### Student Access Management
- [ ] Assign equipment access permissions to students
- [ ] Track student equipment usage and training status
- [ ] Monitor equipment checkout/return processes
- [ ] Generate equipment usage reports for student evaluation

### Maintenance and Safety
- [ ] Schedule preventive maintenance for equipment
- [ ] Report equipment problems and track repair status
- [ ] Access safety protocols and training materials
- [ ] Monitor equipment certification and calibration dates

### Resource Coordination
- [ ] Share equipment with other professors
- [ ] Coordinate resource allocation across multiple courses
- [ ] Request equipment purchases through proper channels
- [ ] Track equipment utilization rates and efficiency

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details
- Build equipment database with comprehensive metadata
- Implement calendar-based booking system
- Create QR code scanning for equipment tracking
- Develop maintenance workflow system

### Integration Requirements
- Integrate with university asset management systems
- Connect to procurement and purchasing systems
- Interface with safety and compliance databases
- Link to student management systems

### Performance Requirements
- Equipment search results load within 2 seconds
- Booking confirmations process within 1 second
- Real-time availability updates across all users
- Equipment status updates propagate within 30 seconds

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access to expensive or dangerous equipment
- Audit trails for all equipment access and usage
- Secure handling of equipment purchase information
- Data protection for student usage patterns

## Dependencies
- Story 008: Professor Topic Management (for resource planning)
- Story 010: Professor Process Management (for course coordination)
- Story 049: Shared Document Management System (for manuals and protocols)

## Mockups/Wireframes
