# Story 360: Shared Advanced Design System Engine

## Title
Comprehensive Theme Management with Accessibility and Personalization

## Description
As any platform user, I need an advanced design system engine that provides comprehensive theme management with accessibility compliance, role-based adaptation, and real-time customization to ensure a personalized and inclusive user experience.

## Actors
- All Users (Primary)
- System Administrator
- UX Designer
- Accessibility Auditor

## Preconditions
- Design system framework is implemented
- User preferences are stored
- Accessibility standards defined
- Role permissions configured

## Postconditions
- Themes adapt to user preferences
- Accessibility compliance maintained
- Consistent design language applied
- Performance optimized

## Normal Flow
1. User accesses theme customization
2. System detects user role and preferences
3. Design engine presents options:
   - Color schemes
   - Typography settings
   - Layout preferences
   - Component styles
4. User selects customization level:
   - Quick presets
   - Advanced settings
   - Custom CSS
   - Accessibility mode
5. Real-time preview shows changes:
   - Live component updates
   - Responsive breakpoints
   - Animation preferences
   - Contrast adjustments
6. Role-based adaptations apply:
   - Professor: Data-dense layouts
   - Student: Simplified interfaces
   - Secretary: Efficiency tools
   - Leader: Executive views
7. Accessibility engine validates:
   - WCAG compliance check
   - Color contrast ratios
   - Font size minimums
   - Keyboard navigation
8. User saves preferences
9. System applies globally
10. Performance metrics tracked

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Accessibility Override
1. At step 7, accessibility issues detected
2. System suggests corrections
3. User can accept or override
4. Override requires justification
5. Alternative solutions provided
6. Accessibility report generated
7. Flow continues from step 8

### Alternative Flow 2: Organization Branding
1. At step 3, admin selects org branding
2. System loads brand guidelines
3. Constraints applied to options
4. Brand compliance verified
5. Department variations allowed
6. Approval workflow triggered
7. Flow continues from step 5

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: Theme Conflict
1. At step 9, theme conflicts with system
2. Fallback theme activated
3. User notified of issues
4. Debug information collected
5. Support ticket created
6. Default theme restored

### Exception 2: Performance Impact
1. At step 10, performance degraded
2. System identifies heavy elements
3. Optimization suggestions provided
4. User chooses trade-offs
5. Lightweight mode offered
6. Settings adjusted accordingly

## Business Rules
- Accessibility compliance is mandatory
- Brand guidelines must be respected
- Performance impact < 10%
- Theme inheritance follows role hierarchy
- User preferences persist across sessions

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Theme switching < 100ms
- Support 10,000+ concurrent users
- CSS size < 50KB compressed
- 99% browser compatibility
- Real-time sync across devices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Theme changes apply instantly
- [ ] Accessibility validation passes
- [ ] Role-based themes load correctly
- [ ] Custom CSS injection works
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] Cross-browser consistency maintained
- [ ] Mobile themes responsive

## Technical Notes

- Service worker for offline themes
- WebAssembly for complex calculations
- Design tokens for consistency

## UI/UX Considerations

- Visual accessibility indicators
- Smooth transition animations
- Preview before apply
- Undo/redo functionality
- Export/import themes

## Dependencies
- Stories: 079, 088, 001, 003
- Design system framework
