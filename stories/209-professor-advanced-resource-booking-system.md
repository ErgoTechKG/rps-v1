# Story 209: Professor Advanced Resource Booking System

## Title
Professor Advanced Resource Booking System for Laboratory Equipment and Facilities

## Story
As a professor, I want an advanced resource booking system so that I can efficiently reserve laboratory equipment, meeting rooms, and other institutional resources with intelligent conflict detection, collaborative scheduling, and integration with my course management workflows.

## Background
Professors need a sophisticated booking system that goes beyond simple calendar scheduling to manage complex laboratory resources, equipment dependencies, and collaborative research needs while preventing conflicts and optimizing resource utilization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Equipment and Facility Management
- [ ] Comprehensive resource catalog with detailed specifications and availability
- [ ] Equipment dependency tracking and automatic bundling of related resources
- [ ] Real-time availability status with live updates from IoT sensors
- [ ] Resource usage history and maintenance scheduling integration
- [ ] Capacity planning tools for group activities and classes

### Intelligent Scheduling Features
- [ ] AI-powered conflict detection and resolution suggestions
- [ ] Automatic scheduling optimization for recurring bookings
- [ ] Smart recommendations based on course requirements and past usage
- [ ] Integration with course schedules and academic calendar
- [ ] Buffer time calculation for setup and cleanup activities

### Collaborative Booking Management
- [ ] Shared booking permissions for research team collaboration
- [ ] Booking approval workflows for high-value or restricted equipment
- [ ] Resource sharing protocols between departments and faculty
- [ ] Group booking coordination for joint research projects
- [ ] Guest access booking for external collaborators

### Advanced Booking Controls
- [ ] Recurring booking patterns with flexible modification options
- [ ] Priority-based booking queues for high-demand resources
- [ ] Waitlist management with automatic notification systems
- [ ] Booking modification tracking and audit trails
- [ ] Emergency override capabilities for urgent research needs

## Technical Requirements

### Resource Management System
- Equipment database with specifications, manuals, and usage guidelines
- Real-time status tracking integration with laboratory management systems
- Maintenance scheduling and downtime notification systems
- User permissions and access control for different resource types
- API integration with existing institutional booking systems

### Intelligent Scheduling Engine
- Machine learning algorithms for usage pattern analysis
- Conflict detection algorithms with resolution recommendations
- Optimization algorithms for resource allocation efficiency
- Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
- Notification system for booking confirmations and reminders

### User Interface System
- Responsive calendar interface with multiple view options
- Drag-and-drop booking creation and modification
- Advanced search and filtering for resource discovery
- Mobile-optimized interface for on-the-go booking management
- Integration with professor dashboard and course management

## UI/UX Requirements

### Resource Discovery Interface
- Visual resource catalog with images, specifications, and availability indicators
- Advanced filtering by equipment type, capabilities, location, and availability
- Resource comparison tools for selecting optimal equipment combinations
- Favorites and frequently used resources quick access
- Integration with course planning workflows

### Booking Management Dashboard
- Calendar view with color-coded booking types and resource categories
- Drag-and-drop interface for easy booking creation and modification
- Conflict visualization with alternative suggestion display
- Bulk booking tools for semester-long course planning
- Quick action buttons for common booking operations

### Collaboration Features
- Shared calendar views for research team coordination
- Booking request and approval workflows with status tracking
- Comment and communication tools for booking coordination
- Integration with project management and research collaboration tools
- Guest booking interface for external collaborator access

## Dependencies
- Story 008: Professor Topic Management (course integration)
- Story 010: Professor Process Management (workflow integration)
- Story 049: Shared Document Management System (resource documentation)
- Story 074: Professor Laboratory Resource Management (basic resource management)

## Risks and Considerations
- Integration complexity with existing institutional booking systems
- Real-time synchronization challenges across multiple systems
- User adoption and training requirements for advanced features
- Data privacy and security for research project information
- Scalability concerns for high-volume booking scenarios

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Advanced resource booking system fully operational with all equipment types
- [ ] Intelligent scheduling and conflict detection working accurately
- [ ] Collaborative booking features tested with research teams
- [ ] Integration with existing course management systems complete
- [ ] Mobile interface fully functional and user-tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for high-volume booking scenarios
- [ ] User training documentation and support materials created
- [ ] Security audit completed for resource access controls
