## Story
**As a** Professor  
**I want** an intelligent presentation mode for evaluation sessions and defenses  
**So that** I can conduct seamless presentations, scoring, and feedback sessions with students while maintaining focus on the evaluation process

## Background
The professor UI design specifies advanced presentation capabilities during defense scoring and evaluation sessions. This includes features for full-screen presentation mode, real-time scoring interface, and seamless transition between evaluation criteria without disrupting the presentation flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Presentation Interface
- [ ] **Full-Screen Mode**: Enter distraction-free presentation mode during defenses
- [ ] **Dual Display Support**: Separate presenter and audience views on multiple monitors
- [ ] **Real-Time Scoring**: Score evaluation criteria without leaving presentation mode
- [ ] **Quick Navigation**: Navigate between evaluation sections using keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] **Timer Integration**: Built-in presentation timer with alerts and time tracking

### Evaluation Features
- [ ] **Live Feedback**: Provide real-time feedback during presentations
- [ ] **Scoring Templates**: Use pre-configured scoring rubrics and templates
- [ ] **Note Taking**: Take structured notes during presentations
- [ ] **Recording Support**: Optional session recording with proper permissions
- [ ] **Multi-Evaluator Mode**: Support multiple evaluators scoring simultaneously

### Seamless Workflow
- [ ] **Auto-Save**: Automatically save scores and feedback during sessions
- [ ] **Quick Comments**: Use pre-defined comment templates for efficiency
- [ ] **Session Management**: Manage multiple consecutive evaluation sessions
- [ ] **Export Capabilities**: Export evaluation results immediately after sessions
- [ ] **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing grading workflows
