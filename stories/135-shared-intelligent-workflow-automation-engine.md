# Story 135: Shared Intelligent Workflow Automation Engine

## Overview
As a system user, I want an intelligent workflow automation engine that can learn from user patterns, automate repetitive tasks, and optimize process flows across all roles, so that I can focus on high-value activities while the system handles routine operations.

## User Story
**As a** system user across all roles
**I want** an intelligent workflow automation engine
**So that** repetitive tasks are automated, processes are optimized, and I can focus on strategic and creative work

## Background
From the shared-ui.md design (lines 322-345) and secretary-ui.md (lines 820-825), the system needs advanced workflow automation capabilities that go beyond simple task automation. The design shows requirements for intelligent process optimization, adaptive workflows, and cross-role automation coordination.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Intelligent Task Recognition and Automation
- **Given** I perform repetitive tasks in the system
- **When** the AI engine analyzes my usage patterns
- **Then** it should:
  - Identify repetitive task sequences automatically
  - Suggest automation opportunities with confidence scores
  - Learn from my feedback to improve suggestions
  - Create automated workflows based on my approval
  - Adapt automation based on changing patterns

### 2. Cross-Role Workflow Orchestration
- **Given** processes involve multiple roles
- **When** a workflow spans different user types
- **Then** the system should:
  - Coordinate handoffs between roles automatically
  - Send appropriate notifications at each stage
  - Handle role-specific variations in the same process
  - Maintain process visibility across all participants
  - Escalate delays or bottlenecks appropriately

### 3. Dynamic Process Optimization
- **Given** workflows are running in the system
- **When** the engine analyzes performance data
- **Then** it should:
  - Identify process bottlenecks and inefficiencies
  - Suggest process improvements with impact analysis
  - A/B test different workflow variations
  - Automatically implement approved optimizations
  - Roll back changes that don't improve performance

### 4. Contextual Automation Triggers
- **Given** I work in different contexts and situations
- **When** specific conditions are met
- **Then** the automation should:
  - Trigger appropriate workflows based on context
  - Adapt behavior based on time, deadline proximity, workload
  - Consider user availability and preferences
  - Handle exception cases gracefully
  - Learn from context-specific outcomes

### 5. Intelligent Form and Data Processing
- **Given** I need to process forms and data entry
- **When** I interact with data entry interfaces
- **Then** the system should:
  - Auto-populate fields based on context and history
  - Validate data intelligently with smart error messages
  - Suggest corrections and improvements
  - Extract data from uploaded documents automatically
  - Route completed forms to appropriate next steps

### 6. Workflow Analytics and Insights
- **Given** I want to understand workflow performance
- **When** I access workflow analytics
- **Then** I should see:
  - Process efficiency metrics and trends
  - Automation success rates and ROI analysis
  - User satisfaction scores for automated processes
  - Bottleneck identification and resolution tracking
  - Continuous improvement recommendations

### 7. Customizable Automation Rules
- **Given** I have specific workflow requirements
- **When** I configure automation settings
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - Create custom automation rules with conditions
  - Set up approval workflows for different scenarios
  - Define escalation paths and timelines
  - Configure notification preferences and timing
  - Override automation when manual intervention is needed

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements
- Machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition
- Workflow engine with rule-based and AI-driven automation
- Integration APIs for connecting different system components
- Real-time process monitoring and analytics
- User behavior analysis and learning capabilities

### UI Components
- Workflow designer with visual process mapping
- Automation suggestion interface with approval workflows
- Process monitoring dashboards
- Custom rule configuration interfaces
- Analytics and reporting dashboards

### Data Model
```
AutomationWorkflow {
  id, name, description, triggers, steps,
  conditions, approvalRequired, active,
  successRate, avgExecutionTime,
  lastOptimized, userFeedback
}

WorkflowStep {
  id, type, action, parameters, nextSteps,
  roleRequired, automationLevel, fallbackAction,
  executionHistory, performanceMetrics
}
```

## Dependencies
- Story 082: Secretary Advanced Workflow Automation (for specific secretary workflows)
- Story 004: Notification System (for workflow notifications)
- Story 001: User Authentication (for role-based workflow execution)
- Story 047: Advanced Analytics and Reporting (for workflow analytics)

## Priority
High - Essential for system efficiency and user productivity across all roles

## Notes
- Should integrate with existing system components seamlessly
- Needs careful consideration of privacy and data security
- Should support gradual rollout and user adoption
- Consider different automation comfort levels across user types
- Should provide clear visibility into automated actions and decisions
