## Title
Secretary Cross-Platform Integration Orchestrator

## Role
Secretary

## Description
As a secretary, I need a cross-platform integration orchestrator that seamlessly connects all institutional systems, automates data synchronization, manages API interactions, and provides unified workflow coordination across diverse technology platforms.

## Background
The UI design specifications (secretary-ui.md lines 1069-1125) describe a comprehensive integration platform that orchestrates complex workflows across multiple systems, ensures data consistency, and provides centralized management of all institutional technology integrations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Integration Management Platform
- [ ] Provide unified interface for managing all system integrations
- [ ] Support multiple integration patterns (APIs, webhooks, batch processing, real-time streaming)
- [ ] Enable visual workflow design for cross-platform processes
- [ ] Maintain integration inventory with health monitoring and documentation

### Data Synchronization and Consistency
- [ ] Ensure real-time data synchronization across all connected systems
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution mechanisms for data inconsistencies
- [ ] Provide data transformation and mapping capabilities
- [ ] Support both real-time and batch synchronization modes

### Workflow Orchestration
- [ ] Coordinate complex multi-system workflows with error handling
- [ ] Support conditional logic and branching in workflow execution
- [ ] Provide workflow monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Enable automatic retry and failover mechanisms

### API Management and Security
- [ ] Centralize API key and credential management
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and usage monitoring
- [ ] Provide security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Support API versioning and backward compatibility

### Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Monitor integration health and performance metrics
- [ ] Provide real-time alerts for integration failures
- [ ] Generate comprehensive integration analytics and reports
- [ ] Track data flow and transformation across systems

## Technical Notes

### Architecture
- Enterprise service bus (ESB) or API gateway architecture
- Message queue system for reliable async processing
- Workflow orchestration engine with state management
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Integration Requirements
- Student Information System APIs
- Learning Management System integration
- Financial and HR system connectivity
- External vendor and regulatory platform APIs

### Performance Requirements
- Process integration requests within 2 seconds
- Support high-throughput data synchronization (1M+ records/hour)
- 99.9% uptime for critical integration pathways
- Real-time monitoring with sub-minute alert response

### Security Requirements
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit
- Secure credential storage and rotation
- Access control and audit logging
- Regular security assessments and compliance validation
