# Story 116: Leader Strategic Scenario Planning System

## Description
As a **Leader**, I want to access a strategic scenario planning system that allows me to model different future scenarios and their potential impacts on educational outcomes, so that I can make strategic decisions with confidence and prepare for various contingencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario Modeling and Simulation
- [ ] Create and configure multiple future scenarios with different parameters
- [ ] Model resource allocation changes and their potential impacts
- [ ] Simulate policy changes and educational reform effects
- [ ] Include demographic and enrollment projection modeling
- [ ] Support sensitivity analysis for key variables

### Predictive Impact Analysis
- [ ] Predict student outcomes under different scenarios
- [ ] Forecast resource requirements and budget implications
- [ ] Analyze potential risks and opportunities for each scenario
- [ ] Include timeline projections and implementation phases
- [ ] Generate confidence intervals and uncertainty ranges

### AI-Powered Optimization
- [ ] Use AI to suggest optimal resource allocation strategies
- [ ] Provide automated scenario generation based on historical patterns
- [ ] Include intelligent recommendation engine for policy decisions
- [ ] Support goal-based optimization with constraint handling
- [ ] Generate alternative strategies for achieving objectives

### Collaborative Planning Tools
- [ ] Support multi-stakeholder scenario planning sessions
- [ ] Provide shared workspace for strategy development
- [ ] Include voting and consensus-building tools
- [ ] Support document collaboration and version control
- [ ] Enable cross-functional team planning capabilities

### Strategic Implementation Tracking
- [ ] Monitor real-world outcomes against scenario predictions
- [ ] Track implementation progress and milestone achievement
- [ ] Provide variance analysis between planned and actual results
- [ ] Include adaptive planning based on emerging trends
- [ ] Generate lessons learned and improvement recommendations

## Technical Notes
- Integrate with existing decision support system (Story 072)
- Connect to predictive analytics platform (Story 080)
- Implement scenario modeling algorithms and simulation engines
- Support complex data visualization and interaction
- Ensure scalability for large-scale institutional modeling

## Dependencies
- Story 072: Leader Decision Support System
- Story 080: Leader Predictive Analytics System
- Story 042: Leader AI Report Generation
- Story 045: Leader Curriculum Design

## Effort Estimate
Large (8-13 story points)

## Priority
Medium - Enables advanced strategic planning and risk management
