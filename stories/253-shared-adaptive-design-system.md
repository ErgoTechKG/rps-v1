# Story 253: Shared Adaptive Design System Engine

## Description
As any platform user, I want an adaptive design system that automatically adjusts UI components and accessibility features based on my preferences and needs so that I can have an optimal user experience regardless of my device, abilities, or usage context while maintaining consistent design standards.

## User Story
```
As any platform user
I want an adaptive design system with automatic UI adjustments
So that I can have an optimal user experience regardless of my device or accessibility needs
```

## Acceptance Criteria
