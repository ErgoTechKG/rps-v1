# Story 364: Leader Governance Policy Lifecycle Manager

## Title
Comprehensive Policy Management with Impact Simulation and Compliance

## Description
As a Leader, I need a comprehensive policy lifecycle management system with impact simulation, workflow automation, and compliance monitoring to effectively create, implement, and maintain institutional policies while understanding their effects before deployment.

## Actors
- Leader (Primary)
- Policy Committee
- Department Heads
- Compliance Officer
- Affected Stakeholders

## Preconditions
- Leader has policy creation authority
- Governance framework established
- Stakeholder roles defined
- Historical policy data available

## Postconditions
- Policies created and approved
- Impact analysis completed
- Implementation planned
- Compliance monitored

## Normal Flow
1. Leader accesses Policy Manager
2. System displays policy dashboard:
   - Active policies
   - Pending approvals
   - Under review
   - Archived versions
   - Compliance status
3. Leader initiates new policy:
   - Select policy type
   - Define scope
   - Set objectives
   - Identify stakeholders
4. Policy editor provides:
   - Structured templates
   - Legal language library
   - Cross-reference tools
   - Version tracking
   - Collaborative editing
5. Impact simulation activated:
   - Affected population analysis
   - Resource requirements
   - Cost projections
   - Risk assessment
   - Benefit modeling
6. Simulation results visualized:
   - Heat maps of impact
   - Timeline projections
   - Scenario comparisons
   - Sensitivity analysis
7. Workflow automation:
   - Review assignments
   - Approval routing
   - Deadline tracking
   - Reminder scheduling
   - Escalation rules
8. Stakeholder feedback:
   - Comment collection
   - Concern tracking
   - Suggestion integration
   - Consensus building
9. Policy finalization:
   - Final approval
   - Publication planning
   - Training requirements
   - Implementation timeline
10. Compliance monitoring begins

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Policy Amendment
1. At step 2, Leader selects existing policy
2. Amendment wizard launches
3. Changes tracked with rationale
4. Limited impact simulation
5. Expedited approval path
6. Version comparison tools
7. Flow continues from step 8

### Alternative Flow 2: Emergency Policy
1. At step 3, emergency flag set
2. Streamlined process activated
3. Minimal required approvals
4. Rapid impact assessment
5. Immediate implementation
6. Post-implementation review
7. Full process completed later

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: Simulation Shows Negative Impact
1. At step 6, severe negative impact predicted
2. System highlights concerns
3. Alternative approaches suggested
4. Policy revision required
5. Re-simulation performed
6. Iterative improvement

### Exception 2: Approval Deadlock
1. At step 8, consensus not reached
2. Escalation triggered
3. Mediation tools activated
4. Compromise options generated
5. Vote or executive decision
6. Process documented

## Business Rules
- All policies require impact assessment
- Minimum review period enforced
- Compliance metrics mandatory
- Version control maintained
- Audit trail preserved

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Simulation completes < 30 seconds
- Support 100+ concurrent reviewers
- Document versioning unlimited
- 99.9% system availability
- Full text search capability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Policy creation follows governance rules
- [ ] Impact simulation provides insights
- [ ] Workflow automation reduces delays
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback integrated
- [ ] Compliance monitoring active
- [ ] Version control comprehensive
- [ ] Reporting meets requirements

## Technical Notes
- Machine learning for impact prediction
- Blockchain for approval tracking
- Natural language processing
- Graph database for relationships
- Business intelligence integration

## UI/UX Considerations
- Executive dashboard view
- Visual policy timeline
- Drag-drop workflow builder
- Mobile approval capability
- Accessibility compliance
- Multi-language support

## Dependencies
- Stories: 046, 043, 044, 077
- Document management system
- Workflow engine
- Analytics platform
- Communication system

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Simulation inaccuracy
  - **Mitigation**: Continuous model improvement
- **Risk**: Stakeholder resistance
  - **Mitigation**: Change management support
- **Risk**: Compliance complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Automated checking tools

## Assumptions
- Leaders value data-driven decisions
- Stakeholders will participate
- Historical data is available
- Compliance is prioritized
