# Story 249: Professor Student Research Interest Mapper

## Description
As a professor, I want a visual research interest mapping system that displays student interests, skills, and project requirements in an interactive format so that I can optimize student-project matching, identify skill gaps, and make data-driven decisions for research team formation.

## User Story
```
As a professor
I want a visual research interest mapping system with matching analytics
So that I can optimize student-project assignments and research team formation
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Interest Mapping
- [ ] Display student interests as interactive knowledge graphs
- [ ] Show skill proficiency levels using visual indicators (‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óã)
- [ ] Map research interests to available project topics
- [ ] Visualize student-project compatibility scores
- [ ] Provide drill-down capabilities for detailed student profiles

### Intelligent Matching Algorithm
- [ ] Calculate compatibility scores based on multiple factors
- [ ] Weight matching criteria: academic performance (80%), research interest (60%), practical experience (50%), time availability (30%)
- [ ] Generate ranked recommendation lists for each project
- [ ] Identify optimal student-project pairings
- [ ] Suggest alternative matches when first choices conflict

### Student Profile Analytics
- [ ] Aggregate student academic performance data
- [ ] Map student interests to research domains
- [ ] Track student skill development over time
- [ ] Identify complementary skill sets for team projects
- [ ] Highlight students with unique or rare expertise

### Project Requirements Visualization
- [ ] Define project skill requirements with proficiency levels
- [ ] Map required skills to available student capabilities
- [ ] Identify skill gaps and training needs
- [ ] Visualize project complexity vs. student experience
- [ ] Show time commitment requirements and student availability

### Matching Dashboard Interface
- [ ] Display top student recommendations with match percentages (95%, 88%, 86%)
- [ ] Show color-coded matching factors (üü¢ Strong match, üü° Moderate, üî¥ Weak)
- [ ] Provide one-click selection and reservation
- [ ] Enable drag-and-drop assignment interface
- [ ] Support "what-if" scenarios for different matching strategies

### Advanced Analytics Features
- [ ] Historical matching success rate analysis
- [ ] Predict project completion probability
- [ ] Identify optimal team composition for group projects
- [ ] Generate diversity metrics for research teams
- [ ] Recommend skill development pathways for students

## Technical Requirements
- Graph database for complex relationship mapping
- Machine learning algorithms for matching optimization
- Interactive visualization library (D3.js or similar)
- Real-time data synchronization capabilities
- Export functionality for matching decisions and reports

## Dependencies
- Story 037: Professor AI Student Matching
- Story 009: Professor Student Selection Process
- Story 013: Student Application Process
- Story 012: Student Topic Browsing and Discovery

## Business Value
- Improves student-project matching success rate by 35%
- Reduces manual matching time by 70%
- Enhances student satisfaction and project outcomes
- Optimizes resource allocation and skill utilization
- Provides data-driven insights for program improvement

## UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive visual interface with clear matching indicators
- Interactive elements for exploring different matching scenarios
- Color-coded system for quick decision making
- Mobile-responsive design for flexible access
- Export capabilities for record keeping and reporting

## Acceptance Definition
The story is complete when professors can visualize student research interests and skills through interactive mapping, receive AI-powered matching recommendations with compatibility scores, analyze student profiles and project requirements, and make optimal assignment decisions using data-driven insights and visual analytics.
