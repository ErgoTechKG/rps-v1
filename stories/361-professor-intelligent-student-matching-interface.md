# Story 361: Professor Intelligent Student Matching Interface

## Title
Advanced Student Matching System with Customizable Weight Parameters

## Description
As a Professor, I need an intelligent student matching interface with adjustable weight parameters, visual factor analysis, and transparent recommendation reasoning to make informed decisions when selecting students for research projects or specialized courses.

## Actors
- Professor (Primary)
- Students (Candidates)
- AI Matching Engine
- Department Administrator

## Preconditions
- Professor has selection privileges
- Student profiles are complete
- Matching criteria are defined
- AI models are trained

## Postconditions
- Optimal student matches identified
- Selection decisions documented
- Match reasoning recorded
- Students notified appropriately

## Normal Flow
1. Professor accesses Student Matching Interface
2. System displays matching configuration:
   - Available student pool
   - Default matching criteria
   - Historical success patterns
   - Current project requirements
3. Professor adjusts weight parameters:
   - Academic performance (0-100%)
   - Research interests (0-100%)
   - Skill alignment (0-100%)
   - Availability (0-100%)
   - Prior experience (0-100%)
4. Visual sliders show real-time impact:
   - Student rankings update
   - Match scores recalculate
   - Fit indicators change
   - Trade-offs highlighted
5. System provides factor explanations:
   - Why each factor matters
   - Impact on project success
   - Historical correlations
   - Recommendation confidence
6. AI generates recommendations:
   - Top 10 candidates
   - Match score breakdowns
   - Strengths/weaknesses
   - Alternative suggestions
7. Professor reviews detailed profiles:
   - Academic transcripts
   - Portfolio samples
   - Professor feedback
   - Availability calendar
8. Comparison mode enables:
   - Side-by-side analysis
   - Differential highlighting
   - Team composition preview
   - Diversity metrics
9. Professor makes selections
10. System sends notifications

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Team Building Mode
1. At step 3, Professor selects team mode
2. System switches to multi-student view
3. Complementary skills emphasized
4. Team dynamics predicted
5. Optimal combinations suggested
6. Professor builds balanced team
7. Flow continues from step 9

### Alternative Flow 2: Constraint-Based Matching
1. At step 2, Professor sets hard constraints
2. System filters candidate pool
3. Only eligible students shown
4. Weights apply within constraints
5. Smaller pool deep analysis
6. Flow continues from step 4

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: Insufficient Candidates
1. At step 6, too few qualified students
2. System relaxes constraints gradually
3. Shows impact of each relaxation
4. Suggests alternative approaches
5. Professor adjusts expectations
6. Wider search initiated

### Exception 2: Conflicting Selections
1. At step 9, student already selected
2. System shows conflict details
3. Priority resolution interface
4. Alternative candidates suggested
5. Negotiation tools provided
6. Fair resolution achieved

## Business Rules
- Weight parameters must sum to 100%
- Minimum 3 factors required for matching
- Student consent required for consideration
- Diversity goals must be tracked
- Historical data informs recommendations

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Matching calculations < 3 seconds
- Support 500+ student profiles
- Real-time parameter updates
- Mobile-responsive interface
- Export capabilities for reports

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Weight adjustments update instantly
- [ ] Factor explanations are clear
- [ ] Recommendations are explainable
- [ ] Visual interface is intuitive
- [ ] Comparison tools function properly
- [ ] Team mode produces balanced groups
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

## Technical Notes
- React for interactive UI
- TensorFlow.js for client-side ML
- GraphQL for efficient queries
- Redis for caching calculations
- D3.js for visualizations

## UI/UX Considerations
- Drag-and-drop weight adjustment
- Color-coded match quality
- Expandable detail panels
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
- Touch-friendly on tablets
- Dark mode for extended use

## Dependencies
- Stories: 037, 009, 013, 047
- Student information system
- Machine learning platform
- Analytics engine
- Notification service

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Bias in AI recommendations
  - **Mitigation**: Regular bias audits and transparency
- **Risk**: Over-reliance on metrics
  - **Mitigation**: Holistic view encouragement
- **Risk**: Student privacy concerns
  - **Mitigation**: Consent and data minimization

## Assumptions
- Sufficient student data exists
- Professors understand weighting
- Students consent to matching
- AI recommendations improve outcomes
