# Story 397: Professor Intelligent Resource Recommendation Engine

## Description

As a professor, I want an intelligent resource recommendation engine that suggests relevant teaching materials, research papers, and educational resources based on my course content and teaching patterns, so that I can enhance my courses with high-quality, relevant materials efficiently.

## User Story

**As a** professor  
**I want** AI-powered recommendations for teaching resources and materials  
**So that** I can easily discover and integrate high-quality content that enhances my courses

## Acceptance Criteria

### Intelligent Content Discovery
- [ ] AI-powered analysis of course content to identify relevant resource categories
- [ ] Integration with academic databases and open educational resources
- [ ] Personalized recommendations based on teaching history and preferences
- [ ] Real-time suggestions during course content creation
- [ ] Collaborative filtering based on resources used by similar professors

### Resource Quality Assessment
- [ ] Automatic quality scoring based on academic metrics and peer reviews
- [ ] Relevance ranking using natural language processing and semantic analysis
- [ ] Currency check to ensure resources are up-to-date and accurate
- [ ] Accessibility evaluation for inclusive educational materials
- [ ] Copyright and licensing verification for legal compliance

### Integration and Management
- [ ] One-click integration of recommended resources into course materials
- [ ] Resource library with personal collections and shared folders
- [ ] Bookmark and annotation system for future reference
- [ ] Usage tracking and effectiveness analytics
- [ ] Automatic updates when better versions of resources become available

### Customization and Learning
- [ ] Preference learning from professor feedback and usage patterns
- [ ] Subject-specific recommendation tuning
- [ ] Difficulty level matching for different student populations
- [ ] Multi-format support (videos, articles, datasets, simulations)
- [ ] Cultural and linguistic diversity considerations in recommendations

## Technical Requirements

### AI and Machine Learning
- Natural language processing for content analysis using BERT/GPT models

- Recommendation widgets integrated into course builder
- Resource preview and comparison tools
- Personal resource library with organization features
- Analytics dashboard showing resource effectiveness

### Database Schema
```sql
resource_metadata
recommendation_models
professor_preferences
resource_usage_analytics
content_quality_scores
```

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/professor/resources/recommend/{courseId}
