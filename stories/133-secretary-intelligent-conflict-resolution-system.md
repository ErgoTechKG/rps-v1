# Story 133: Secretary Intelligent Conflict Resolution System

## Overview
As a secretary, I want an intelligent conflict resolution system that automatically detects scheduling, resource, and process conflicts and provides resolution recommendations, so that I can proactively prevent problems and maintain smooth operations.

## User Story
**As a** secretary managing course operations
**I want** an AI-powered conflict detection and resolution system
**So that** I can prevent scheduling conflicts, resource clashes, and process bottlenecks before they impact students and faculty

## Background
From the secretary-ui.md design (lines 402-412, 310-320), secretaries need sophisticated conflict detection and resolution tools. The UI design shows requirements for intelligent problem identification, automated resolution suggestions, and proactive intervention capabilities that go beyond basic monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Conflict Detection
- **Given** I am monitoring course operations
- **When** the system analyzes current and planned activities
- **Then** it should automatically detect:
  - Schedule conflicts (student/professor availability)
  - Resource conflicts (lab spaces, equipment)
  - Capacity conflicts (enrollment vs. available spots)
  - Timeline conflicts (overlapping deadlines)
  - Policy conflicts (regulation violations)

### 2. Intelligent Resolution Recommendations
- **Given** the system detects a conflict
- **When** I review the conflict details
- **Then** I should see:
  - Conflict severity assessment (low/medium/high/critical)
  - Potential impact analysis
  - 3-5 ranked resolution options
  - Estimated effort and time for each solution
  - Stakeholder impact assessment for each option

### 3. Automated Conflict Prevention
- **Given** I am scheduling new activities
- **When** I enter details for events, meetings, or deadlines
- **Then** the system should:
  - Real-time conflict checking during data entry
  - Suggest optimal time slots to avoid conflicts
  - Block problematic combinations automatically
  - Provide alternative suggestions immediately
  - Flag potential future conflicts

### 4. Stakeholder Communication Hub
- **Given** a conflict requires stakeholder coordination
- **When** I initiate conflict resolution
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - Send automated conflict notifications to affected parties
  - Collect availability updates from stakeholders
  - Coordinate rescheduling with affected parties
  - Track response status and follow up automatically
  - Generate resolution communication templates

### 5. Escalation Management
- **Given** a conflict cannot be resolved automatically
- **When** manual intervention is required
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - Escalate to appropriate decision makers
  - Set escalation timelines and reminders
  - Track escalation status and responses
  - Maintain audit trail of resolution decisions
  - Implement approved resolutions across systems

### 6. Resource Reallocation Intelligence
- **Given** there are resource conflicts
- **When** I need to reallocate resources
- **Then** the system should:
  - Suggest optimal resource redistribution
  - Identify underutilized alternative resources
  - Calculate reallocation impact and cost
  - Automate resource booking changes
  - Notify affected users of changes

### 7. Conflict Pattern Analysis
- **Given** I want to prevent recurring conflicts
- **When** I analyze historical conflict data
- **Then** I should see:
  - Common conflict patterns and root causes
  - Peak conflict periods and triggers
  - Resolution effectiveness metrics
  - Prevention strategy recommendations
  - Predictive conflict forecasting

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements
- Machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition
- Real-time data processing and analysis
- Integration with scheduling and resource management systems
- Automated notification and communication systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting capabilities

### UI Components
- Conflict detection dashboard with severity indicators
- Interactive resolution workflow interface
- Stakeholder communication management panel
- Resource reallocation visualization tools
- Historical analysis and reporting dashboards

### Data Model
```
Conflict {
  id, type, severity, detectedAt, resolvedAt,
  description, affectedResources, affectedUsers,
  resolutionOptions: [ResolutionOption],
  chosenResolution, escalationHistory,
  preventionTags, learningsCapture
}

ResolutionOption {
  id, title, description, estimatedEffort,
  stakeholderImpact, successProbability,
  automationPossible, resourceRequirements
}
```

## Dependencies
- Story 018: Secretary Process Monitoring (for data sources)
- Story 055: Secretary Monitoring Control Center (for dashboard integration)
- Story 005: Shared Calendar System (for scheduling data)
- Story 004: Notification System (for stakeholder communication)

## Priority
High - Critical for preventing operational disruptions and maintaining system efficiency

## Notes
- Should integrate with existing monitoring and alerting systems
- Needs machine learning capabilities for pattern recognition
- Should support different conflict types and resolution strategies
- Consider integration with external calendar and resource systems
