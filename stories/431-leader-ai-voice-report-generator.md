## Title
Leader AI-Powered Voice Report Generator

## Role
Leader

## Description
As a leader, I need an AI-powered voice-activated report generation system that allows me to create, edit, and customize institutional reports through natural language commands, significantly reducing the time required for report preparation while maintaining professional quality.

## Background
The UI design specifications (leader-ui.md lines 263-294) describe an advanced voice interface system for report generation that leverages AI to understand natural language instructions and automatically generate comprehensive reports. This system should support multiple report types and allow for real-time collaboration.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Voice Interface System
- [ ] Implement natural language processing for voice commands
- [ ] Support multiple languages and dialects for international users
- [ ] Provide voice feedback and confirmation for complex operations
- [ ] Enable hands-free operation with wake word activation

### AI Report Generation Engine
- [ ] Generate reports from voice instructions (e.g., "Create quarterly academic performance report")
- [ ] Support multiple report templates (annual, quarterly, specialized, ad-hoc)
- [ ] Auto-populate data from connected institutional systems
- [ ] Apply intelligent formatting and professional styling

### Content Editing and Customization
- [ ] Allow voice-based content editing and refinement
- [ ] Support insertion of specific data points and visualizations through voice commands
- [ ] Enable collaborative editing with voice annotations
- [ ] Provide intelligent suggestions for report improvement

### Output and Distribution
- [ ] Generate reports in multiple formats (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, web)
- [ ] Support automatic distribution to stakeholder groups
- [ ] Enable version control with voice-based change tracking
- [ ] Provide accessibility features for audio-based report consumption

## Technical Notes
