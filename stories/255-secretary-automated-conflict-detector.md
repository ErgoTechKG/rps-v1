# Story 255: Secretary Automated Conflict Detection System

## Description
As a secretary, I want an automated conflict detection system that identifies scheduling conflicts and resource availability issues before they occur so that I can proactively prevent problems, optimize resource utilization, and maintain smooth operational workflows across all institutional activities.

## User Story
```
As a secretary
I want automated conflict detection for scheduling and resources
So that I can prevent problems before they occur and optimize institutional operations
