# Story 161: Professor Intelligent Workload Management System

## Story Statement
As a **Professor**, I want to **have an intelligent workload management system that optimizes my time allocation and prevents overcommitment**, so that **I can maintain work-life balance while maximizing my effectiveness in teaching, research, and service activities**.

## Feature Details

### Workload Intelligence Engine
- **Time Tracking Integration**: Automatic tracking of time spent on different activities
- **Capacity Planning**: AI-powered analysis of optimal workload distribution
- **Conflict Detection**: Identification of scheduling conflicts and overcommitment risks
- **Priority Optimization**: Intelligent prioritization based on deadlines and importance
- **Burnout Prevention**: Early warning system for excessive workload patterns

### Smart Scheduling Assistant
- **Automatic Calendar Management**: AI-powered scheduling optimization across all activities
- **Buffer Time Allocation**: Intelligent insertion of break time and preparation periods
- **Meeting Optimization**: Analysis and suggestions for more efficient meeting practices
- **Research Time Protection**: Dedicated time blocks for focused research work
- **Travel Time Calculation**: Automatic consideration of travel time between locations

## Acceptance Criteria
