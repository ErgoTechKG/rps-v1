# Story 357: Professor Real-Time AI Detection Dashboard

## Title
Real-Time AI Detection Dashboard with Live Analysis

## Description
As a Professor, I need a real-time AI detection dashboard that provides live analysis of student submissions, showing AI generation probability, similarity patterns, and processing recommendations to maintain academic integrity while providing fair assessment.

## Actors
- Professor (Primary)
- Students (Submission providers)
- AI Detection Service
- System Administrator

## Preconditions
- Professor has grading permissions
- AI detection service is operational
- Student submissions are uploaded
- Detection models are trained and calibrated

## Postconditions
- Submissions are analyzed for AI generation
- Detection reports are generated
- Processing recommendations are provided
- Academic integrity is maintained

## Normal Flow
1. Professor accesses AI Detection Dashboard
2. System displays live submission queue
3. Dashboard shows real-time analysis:
   - Processing progress bars
   - AI probability percentages
   - Similarity heat maps
   - Pattern recognition results
4. Professor selects submission for detailed view
5. System presents comprehensive analysis:
   - Section-by-section AI probability
   - Writing style inconsistencies
   - Source similarity matches
   - Suspicious pattern highlights
6. Dashboard provides processing recommendations:
   - Accept/Flag/Review suggestions
   - Follow-up action items
   - Student meeting recommendations
7. Professor makes informed decision
8. System logs decision and rationale
9. Dashboard updates statistics
10. Process repeats for next submission

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Batch Processing
1. At step 2, Professor selects multiple submissions
2. System initiates batch analysis
3. Dashboard shows parallel processing
4. Results displayed in comparison grid
5. Professor reviews patterns across submissions
6. Bulk actions applied where appropriate
7. Flow continues from step 8

### Alternative Flow 2: Custom Detection Settings
1. At step 3, Professor adjusts detection sensitivity
2. System recalibrates analysis parameters
3. Real-time results update accordingly
4. Professor fine-tunes thresholds
5. Settings saved for future use
6. Flow continues from step 4

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: False Positive Detection
1. At step 6, Professor disagrees with AI assessment
2. System provides override interface
3. Professor documents reasoning
4. Feedback sent to improve model
5. Submission marked for human review
6. Flow continues from step 8

### Exception 2: Service Overload
1. At step 3, detection service is overwhelmed
2. System queues submissions
3. Dashboard shows estimated wait times
4. Priority processing available
5. Professor can defer non-urgent items
6. Flow resumes when capacity available

## Business Rules
- All submissions must be analyzed within 24 hours
- Detection confidence must exceed 70% for auto-flagging
- Professor decisions override AI recommendations
- Student privacy must be maintained
- Detection methods must be transparent

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds
- Support 100+ concurrent analyses
- 99.9% service availability
- Response time < 3 seconds for results
- Mobile-responsive dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Live progress tracking shows accurate status
- [ ] AI probability calculations are explainable
- [ ] Similarity detection identifies known sources
- [ ] Pattern recognition catches style changes
- [ ] Recommendations align with institutional policy
- [ ] Dashboard updates in real-time
- [ ] Batch processing handles 50+ items

## Technical Notes
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- GPU acceleration for AI processing
- Distributed processing for scalability
- Redis caching for performance
- Explainable AI techniques required

## UI/UX Considerations
- Visual progress indicators
- Color-coded probability scales
- Interactive similarity visualizations
- Collapsible detail sections
- Dark mode for extended use

## Dependencies
- Stories: 036, 011, 010, 004
- AI detection models
- Natural language processing service
- Similarity detection engine
- Real-time messaging infrastructure

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: False accusations damage student trust
  - **Mitigation**: Human review for all flags
- **Risk**: Detection methods become known
  - **Mitigation**: Regular model updates
- **Risk**: Processing delays affect grading
  - **Mitigation**: Priority queue system

## Assumptions
- AI detection technology is mature
- Professors understand AI limitations
- Students are informed about detection
- Institution supports AI detection use
