# User Story 094: Professor Batch Operation Tools

## Story Overview

**As a** Professor  
**I want** batch operation tools for grading and task management  
**So that** I can efficiently handle repetitive operations across multiple students and reduce time spent on manual tasks.

## Background

Professors often need to perform similar operations across multiple students, such as grading assignments, sending notifications, or updating task statuses. The UI design specifies batch operation functionality to streamline these processes and improve teaching efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Batch Grading Operations
- [ ] **Batch Score Assignment**: Select multiple assignments and assign scores simultaneously
- [ ] **Grade Distribution**: Apply curve grading or percentage adjustments to selected submissions
- [ ] **Batch Comments**: Add standardized feedback comments to multiple assignments
- [ ] **Grade Export**: Export grades for selected students in various formats (Excel, CSV)

### Batch Task Management
- [ ] **Task Creation**: Create identical tasks for multiple students or groups
- [ ] **Due Date Management**: Bulk update due dates for selected assignments
- [ ] **Task Status Updates**: Mark multiple tasks as reviewed, approved, or requiring revision
- [ ] **Reminder Notifications**: Send batch reminders to students about upcoming deadlines

### Batch Communication
- [ ] **Group Notifications**: Send announcements to selected student groups
- [ ] **Template Messages**: Use pre-defined message templates for common communications
- [ ] **Meeting Invitations**: Schedule group meetings with batch invitations
- [ ] **File Distribution**: Share resources and materials with multiple students simultaneously

### User Interface Requirements
- [ ] **Selection Interface**: Checkbox-based selection system for students/assignments
- [ ] **Batch Action Panel**: Dedicated toolbar with available batch operations
- [ ] **Progress Indicators**: Show operation progress for large batch actions
- [ ] **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental batch operations with confirmation prompts
- [ ] **Undo Functionality**: Allow reversal of recent batch operations where applicable

### Performance & Validation
- [ ] **Operation Queuing**: Handle large batch operations asynchronously
- [ ] **Validation Checks**: Verify data integrity before executing batch operations
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Provide detailed feedback on failed operations within batches
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Log all batch operations for administrative review

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Implement multi-select components for student/assignment selection
- Create batch operation toolbar with action buttons
- Design progress modals for long-running operations
- Implement real-time operation status updates

### Backend
- Develop batch processing APIs for common operations
- Implement transaction rollback for failed batch operations
- Create background job system for large operations
- Design audit logging for batch actions

### Database
- Optimize queries for batch operations
- Implement bulk update/insert operations
- Create batch operation history tables

## Route Structure
```

└── /history          # Operation history and audit logs
```

## Dependencies
- Story 010: Professor Process Management (for task context)
- Story 011: Professor Assessment and Grading (for grading context)
- Story 004: Notification System (for batch communications)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All batch operation interfaces are implemented and functional
- [ ] Batch operations handle errors gracefully with detailed feedback
- [ ] Performance testing completed for operations involving 100+ records
- [ ] User documentation created for batch operation workflows
- [ ] Security review completed for bulk data modification capabilities
- [ ] Accessibility testing passed for all batch operation interfaces

## Notes
- UI design emphasizes efficiency with "批量操作功能减少重复点击" (batch operation functionality reduces repetitive clicking)
- Consider implementing keyboard shortcuts for frequently used batch operations
- Ensure batch operations maintain data integrity and provide clear feedback on partial failures
