# Story 082: Secretary Advanced Workflow Automation

## User Story
As a **secretary**, I want to create and manage automated workflows for routine administrative tasks so that I can reduce manual work and ensure consistent process execution across all course management activities.

## Background
The secretary UI design includes advanced workflow automation capabilities that go beyond simple task reminders to include intelligent process automation, conditional logic, and integration with external systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Workflow Design Interface
- [ ] Visual workflow designer with drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Pre-built workflow templates for common processes
- [ ] Conditional logic and branching capabilities
- [ ] Integration points for external systems and notifications

### Automated Task Execution
- [ ] Automatic task assignment based on roles and workload
- [ ] Scheduled task execution with retry mechanisms
- [ ] Data validation and quality checks
- [ ] Error handling and exception management

### Process Monitoring
- [ ] Real-time workflow execution monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics and bottleneck identification
- [ ] Process completion statistics and reporting
- [ ] Alert system for failed or stalled workflows

### Business Rules Engine
- [ ] Configurable business rules for different scenarios
- [ ] Rule conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Rule testing and validation capabilities
- [ ] Version control for rule changes

### Integration Capabilities
- [ ] API integration with university systems
- [ ] Email and notification automation
- [ ] Document generation and distribution
- [ ] Data synchronization across platforms

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details
- Build workflow engine with BPMN 2.0 support
- Implement rule engine with forward/backward chaining
- Create visual workflow designer interface
- Develop comprehensive monitoring dashboard

### Architecture Requirements
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Message queue system for reliable task execution
- Database optimization for workflow state management
- Caching layer for rule evaluation performance

### Performance Requirements
- Workflow execution starts within 10 seconds of trigger
- Simple workflows complete within 2 minutes
- Complex workflows complete within 30 minutes
- System supports 100+ concurrent workflow executions

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access to workflow design and modification
- Encrypted communication with external systems
- Audit trails for all workflow executions
- Secure handling of sensitive data in workflows

## Dependencies
- Story 016: Secretary Course Setup and Configuration (for base functionality)
- Story 018: Secretary Process Monitoring (for monitoring infrastructure)
- Story 043: Secretary User Management (for role-based automation)

## Mockups/Wireframes
Reference: ui-ux/secretary-ui.md workflow automation section

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Workflow designer interface is fully functional
- [ ] Automated task execution works reliably
- [ ] Process monitoring provides real-time visibility
- [ ] Business rules engine operates correctly
- [ ] Integration capabilities are tested and working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are achieved
- [ ] Security requirements are implemented
- [ ] Documentation for workflow creation is complete
