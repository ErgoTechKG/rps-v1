## Title
Leader Interactive Curriculum Visualization Engine

## Role
Leader

## Description
As a leader, I need an interactive curriculum visualization engine that provides drag-and-drop curriculum design, 3D relationship mapping, and AI-powered optimization suggestions to strategically plan and optimize educational programs across the institution.

## Background
The UI design specifications (leader-ui.md lines 297-475) describe a sophisticated curriculum visualization system that allows leaders to visualize complex curriculum relationships, dependencies, and pathways. This system should provide AI-powered insights for optimization and strategic planning.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Interactive Visualization Interface
- [ ] Provide 3D curriculum mapping with course nodes and relationship edges
- [ ] Support drag-and-drop curriculum design and restructuring
- [ ] Enable real-time visualization of curriculum changes and their impacts
- [ ] Allow multiple view modes (hierarchical, network, timeline, dependency)

### AI-Powered Optimization
- [ ] Analyze curriculum pathways for optimization opportunities
- [ ] Suggest course sequencing improvements based on learning outcome data
- [ ] Identify prerequisite gaps and recommend solutions
- [ ] Provide predictive analysis of student success rates for different pathways

### Curriculum Planning Tools
- [ ] Support strategic curriculum planning with multi-year roadmaps
- [ ] Enable scenario modeling for curriculum changes
- [ ] Provide resource allocation analysis for curriculum initiatives
- [ ] Generate impact assessments for proposed curriculum modifications

### Collaboration and Governance
- [ ] Support collaborative curriculum design with multi-stakeholder input
- [ ] Implement approval workflows for curriculum changes
- [ ] Provide version control and change tracking for curriculum modifications
- [ ] Enable annotation and commenting on curriculum elements

### Integration and Analysis
- [ ] Integrate with existing academic information systems
- [ ] Connect to learning outcome and assessment data
- [ ] Provide benchmarking against industry standards and peer institutions
- [ ] Generate comprehensive curriculum analysis reports

## Technical Notes

### Architecture
- 3D visualization engine using WebGL/Three.js
