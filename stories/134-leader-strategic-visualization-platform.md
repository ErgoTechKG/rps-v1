# Story 134: Leader Strategic Visualization Platform

## Overview
As a leader, I want a comprehensive strategic visualization platform that provides real-time data insights, predictive analytics, and interactive dashboards for institutional decision-making, so that I can make data-driven strategic decisions with confidence.

## User Story
**As a** institutional leader
**I want** an advanced strategic visualization and analytics platform
**So that** I can visualize complex institutional data, identify trends, and make informed strategic decisions based on comprehensive insights

## Background
From the leader-ui.md design (lines 60-87, 232-261), leaders need sophisticated data visualization and analysis capabilities beyond basic reporting. The UI design shows requirements for interactive dashboards, predictive analytics, and strategic decision support tools.

  - Heat maps showing performance across departments
  - Real-time data updates with refresh indicators
  - Customizable widget arrangements

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Data Analysis
- **Given** I need to analyze complex institutional data
- **When** I use the analysis tools
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - Create custom data views with drag-and-drop interface
  - Apply multiple filters and groupings simultaneously
  - Compare data across different time periods and cohorts
  - Drill down from summary to detailed views
  - Save and share custom analysis views

### 3. Predictive Analytics and Forecasting
