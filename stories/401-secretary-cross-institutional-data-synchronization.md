# Story 401: Secretary Cross-Institutional Data Synchronization

## Description

As a secretary, I want a cross-institutional data synchronization system that seamlessly integrates and synchronizes data across multiple institutional systems and external partners, so that I can maintain data consistency and enable comprehensive institutional analytics.

## User Story

**As a** secretary  
**I want** automated synchronization of data across all institutional systems  
**So that** I can ensure data consistency and enable comprehensive cross-system analytics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration with student information systems, HR, finance, and academic systems
- [ ] Real-time data synchronization with conflict resolution algorithms
- [ ] Support for multiple data formats (JSON, XML, CSV, database connections)
- [ ] External partner integration (government agencies, accreditation bodies)
- [ ] Legacy system support with data transformation capabilities

### Data Quality and Governance
- [ ] Automated data validation and quality checking
- [ ] Master data management with golden record maintenance
- [ ] Data lineage tracking for audit and compliance purposes
- [ ] Automated data cleansing and standardization
- [ ] Privacy and security controls for sensitive data handling

### Monitoring and Management
- [ ] Real-time synchronization status dashboard
- [ ] Error detection and automatic retry mechanisms
- [ ] Performance monitoring with optimization recommendations
- [ ] Data flow visualization showing system interconnections
- [ ] Scheduled synchronization with customizable frequency

### Analytics and Reporting
- [ ] Cross-system data analytics with unified reporting
- [ ] Data discrepancy identification and resolution workflows
- [ ] Synchronization performance metrics and trend analysis
- [ ] Impact assessment for data changes across systems
- [ ] Automated compliance reporting for data handling

## Technical Requirements

### Data Integration Platform
- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) architecture for system connectivity
- ETL/ELT pipelines for data transformation and loading
- Message queuing system for reliable data transmission
