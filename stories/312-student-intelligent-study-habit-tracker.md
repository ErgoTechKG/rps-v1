# Story 312: Student Intelligent Study Habit Tracker

## User Story
As a Student, I want an intelligent study habit tracker so that I can understand my learning patterns, optimize my study methods, and build effective long-term academic habits through data-driven insights.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Study Session Monitoring
- [ ] **Automatic session detection** tracking when students are actively studying based on system activity
- [ ] **Manual session logging** allowing students to record offline study time and activities
- [ ] **Focus time measurement** monitoring periods of concentrated work without distractions
- [ ] **Break pattern analysis** tracking rest periods and their impact on productivity
- [ ] **Subject-specific tracking** categorizing study time by course and topic areas

### Learning Pattern Analytics
- [ ] **Peak performance identification** determining optimal study times based on historical data
- [ ] **Learning velocity metrics** measuring how quickly students grasp different types of content
- [ ] **Retention curve analysis** tracking how well students retain information over time
- [ ] **Difficulty progression mapping** identifying which topics require more practice
- [ ] **Multitasking impact assessment** analyzing how context switching affects learning efficiency

### Habit Formation Support
- [ ] **Habit streak tracking** monitoring consistent study behaviors and celebrating milestones
- [ ] **Goal-based recommendations** suggesting incremental improvements to study routines
- [ ] **Habit interruption alerts** identifying when positive patterns are being broken
- [ ] **Environmental factor correlation** analyzing how location, time, and conditions affect performance
- [ ] **Social accountability features** allowing students to share progress with study partners

### Personalized Insights Dashboard
