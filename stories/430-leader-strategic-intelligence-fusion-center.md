## Title
Leader Strategic Intelligence Fusion Center

## Role
Leader

## Description
As a leader, I need a comprehensive strategic intelligence fusion center that aggregates data from multiple sources, applies AI analysis, and provides real-time strategic insights to support institutional decision-making and long-term planning.

## Background
The UI design specifications (leader-ui.md lines 488-520) describe an advanced intelligence platform that goes beyond simple data visualization to provide predictive analytics, scenario modeling, and strategic decision support.
