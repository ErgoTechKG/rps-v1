# Story 207: Shared Cross-Role Workflow Coordination System

## Overview

As a user of any role, I need a comprehensive cross-role workflow coordination system that manages complex processes involving multiple user types, ensures smooth handoffs between roles, maintains process visibility, and provides intelligent automation to streamline institutional operations.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As any user**, I want to participate in multi-role workflows where I can see my part in the larger process and understand how my actions affect other users downstream.

2. **As any user**, I want automatic notifications when workflows require my input or when my previous actions have been processed by others so I stay informed about process status.

3. **As a workflow coordinator**, I want to design and manage complex workflows that span multiple roles and departments so institutional processes can be standardized and optimized.

4. **As any user**, I want clear visibility into workflow status and bottlenecks so I can understand delays and take appropriate action.

### Secondary User Stories

5. **As any user**, I want intelligent workflow suggestions based on common patterns and best practices so I can improve process efficiency.

6. **As a supervisor**, I want oversight capabilities for workflows involving my team members so I can provide support and ensure quality outcomes.

7. **As any user**, I want workflow templates that can be customized for different situations while maintaining core process integrity.

8. **As an administrator**, I want comprehensive audit trails for all cross-role workflows to ensure compliance and enable process improvement.
