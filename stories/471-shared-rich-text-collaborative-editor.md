   - Heading styles and paragraph formatting
   - Lists (bullet, numbered, checklist)
   - Tables with cell merging
   - Image and file embedding
   - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
   - Mathematical equation support

3. **Commenting System**
   - Inline comments with threads
   - @mentions with notifications
   - Comment resolution workflow
