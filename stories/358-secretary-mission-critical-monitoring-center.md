# Story 358: Secretary Mission-Critical Monitoring Center

## Title
Mission-Critical Real-Time Monitoring Center

## Description
As a Secretary, I need a mission-critical monitoring center with real-time system monitoring, predictive analytics, automated alerts, and visual data representation to ensure smooth institutional operations and proactively address potential issues.

## Actors
- Secretary (Primary)
- System Administrators
- Department Heads
- Emergency Response Team

## Preconditions
- Secretary has monitoring privileges
- All systems are instrumented for monitoring
- Alert thresholds are configured
- Historical data is available for predictions

## Postconditions
- System health is continuously monitored
- Issues are detected and alerted in real-time
- Predictive warnings prevent failures
- Operational efficiency is maintained

## Normal Flow
1. Secretary accesses Monitoring Center
2. Dashboard displays comprehensive system status:
   - Live performance metrics
   - Resource utilization graphs
   - Active user statistics
   - System health indicators
3. Real-time data streams update continuously:
   - Server response times
   - Database performance
   - Network latency
   - Application errors
4. Predictive analytics show:
   - Trend projections
   - Capacity warnings
   - Failure probability
   - Maintenance recommendations
5. Secretary monitors alert panel:
   - Critical alerts (red)
   - Warnings (yellow)
   - Information (blue)
   - Resolved issues (green)
6. Visual representations update dynamically:
   - Heat maps of system load
   - Geographic user distribution
   - Service dependency graphs
   - Performance timelines
7. Secretary investigates anomalies
8. System provides root cause analysis
9. Automated responses trigger when configured
10. Secretary coordinates resolution efforts

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Crisis Mode Activation
1. At step 5, critical alert triggers
2. System enters crisis mode
3. Dashboard prioritizes critical information
4. Emergency contacts auto-notified
5. Incident response workflow initiated
6. Real-time collaboration tools activated
7. Flow continues with incident resolution

### Alternative Flow 2: Predictive Maintenance
1. At step 4, system predicts future failure
2. Secretary reviews prediction details
3. Maintenance window scheduled
4. Affected users notified
5. Preventive actions implemented
6. System monitors intervention success
7. Flow returns to normal monitoring

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: Monitoring System Failure
1. At any step, monitoring system fails
2. Backup monitoring activates
3. Limited functionality notification sent
4. Manual monitoring procedures initiated
5. IT team alerted immediately
6. Service restored with priority

### Exception 2: Alert Storm
1. At step 5, multiple systems fail simultaneously
2. Alert aggregation activates
3. Root cause identification prioritized
4. Cascading failures prevented
5. Emergency protocols engaged
6. Senior management notified

## Business Rules
- Critical alerts must notify within 30 seconds
- All alerts must be acknowledged within 5 minutes
- Predictive accuracy must exceed 85%
- Visual updates refresh every second
- Historical data retained for 90 days

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Real-time latency < 1 second
- Support 50+ simultaneous data streams
- 99.99% monitoring uptime
- Handle 10,000 metrics per second
- Responsive design for all devices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Live data updates without page refresh
- [ ] Predictive analytics prevent 80% of failures
- [ ] Alert routing reaches correct personnel
- [ ] Visual representations are intuitive
- [ ] Root cause analysis is accurate
- [ ] Crisis mode activates automatically
- [ ] Mobile access fully functional

## Technical Notes
- Time-series database for metrics
- Stream processing for real-time data
- Machine learning for predictions
- WebSocket for live updates
- Redundant monitoring infrastructure

## UI/UX Considerations
- Customizable dashboard layouts
- Drag-and-drop widget arrangement
- Full-screen mode for operations center
- Color-blind friendly visualizations
- Audible alerts for critical issues

## Dependencies
- Stories: 018, 019, 041, 055
- Monitoring infrastructure
- Time-series database
- Stream processing platform
- Machine learning pipeline

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Alert fatigue from too many notifications
  - **Mitigation**: Smart alert aggregation and filtering
- **Risk**: False predictions cause unnecessary actions
  - **Mitigation**: Confidence thresholds and human verification
- **Risk**: System complexity overwhelms users
  - **Mitigation**: Role-based simplified views

## Assumptions
- Infrastructure supports comprehensive monitoring
- Predictive models are properly trained
- Staff are available for 24/7 monitoring
- Emergency procedures are documented
