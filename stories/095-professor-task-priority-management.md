# User Story 095: Professor Task Priority Management System

## Story Overview

**As a** Professor  
**I want** an intelligent task priority management system  
**So that** I can organize my workload effectively, never miss important deadlines, and focus on high-priority activities first.

## Background

Professors manage multiple concurrent responsibilities including grading, meetings, research, and student supervision. The UI design specifies a sophisticated task management system with priority levels, smart categorization, and visual organization to prevent task oversight and optimize time allocation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task Priority System
- [ ] **Priority Classification**: Assign tasks to priority levels (Red: Urgent, Orange: Important, Green: General)
- [ ] **Smart Priority Detection**: Automatically assign priorities based on deadline proximity and task type
- [ ] **Priority Adjustment**: Allow manual override of system-assigned priorities
- [ ] **Visual Priority Indicators**: Use color coding and icons to clearly display task urgency

### Task Organization Interface
- [ ] **Priority Kanban Board**: Display tasks in columns by priority level with drag-drop functionality
- [ ] **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by category (urgent, important, overdue, completed)
- [ ] **Search and Sort**: Find tasks by keyword and sort by various criteria
- [ ] **Task Dependencies**: Link related tasks and show dependency relationships

### Intelligent Task Management
- [ ] **Deadline Tracking**: Automatic deadline monitoring with escalating alerts
- [ ] **Task Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common academic tasks
- [ ] **Workload Distribution**: Visual representation of task distribution across time periods
- [ ] **Smart Scheduling**: Suggest optimal task scheduling based on priority and time requirements

### Reminder and Alert System
- [ ] **Customizable Reminders**: Set multiple reminder types (email, system notification, calendar)
- [ ] **Escalating Alerts**: Increase reminder frequency as deadlines approach
- [ ] **Overdue Notifications**: Special handling for overdue tasks with escalation options
- [ ] **Delegate Reminders**: Notify relevant parties when tasks require their input

### Task Analytics
- [ ] **Completion Statistics**: Track task completion rates and time patterns
- [ ] **Priority Analysis**: Show distribution of time spent on different priority levels
- [ ] **Efficiency Metrics**: Measure task completion efficiency and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] **Trend Analysis**: Historical view of task patterns and workload changes

### Integration Features
- [ ] **Calendar Sync**: Integrate with external calendar systems
- [ ] **Email Integration**: Create tasks from emails and send task updates
- [ ] **Document Linking**: Attach relevant files and links to tasks
- [ ] **Student Task Coordination**: Coordinate tasks that involve student deliverables

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Implement drag-and-drop Kanban board interface
- Create responsive task card components with priority indicators
- Design notification and reminder management interface
- Build analytics dashboard with charts and metrics

### Backend
- Develop task priority algorithm based on multiple factors
- Implement reminder scheduling and notification system
- Create task analytics and reporting engine
- Design API for task dependencies and relationships

### Database
- Create task priority and categorization schema
- Implement task history and analytics tables
- Design reminder and notification tracking system

## Route Structure
```
/professor/task-management/
├── /dashboard         # Priority overview and kanban board
├── /create           # Task creation with priority assignment
├── /calendar         # Calendar view of tasks and deadlines
├── /analytics        # Task completion analytics and trends
├── /templates        # Task template management
├── /settings         # Reminder preferences and priority rules
└── /archive          # Completed and archived tasks
```

## Dependencies
- Story 010: Professor Process Management (for task context)
- Story 004: Notification System (for reminder functionality)
- Story 005: Shared Calendar System (for calendar integration)
- Story 011: Professor Assessment and Grading (for academic task context)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Task priority system is fully functional with visual indicators
- [ ] Drag-and-drop task organization works smoothly across priority levels
- [ ] Reminder system delivers notifications according to user preferences
- [ ] Analytics dashboard provides meaningful insights into task patterns
- [ ] System handles 500+ concurrent tasks without performance degradation
- [ ] Mobile-responsive interface for task management on-the-go
- [ ] Integration testing completed with calendar and notification systems

## Notes
- UI design emphasizes "任务优先级看板" (task priority kanban) for visual organization
- The system should help professors with "智能任务分类和状态跟踪" (intelligent task classification and status tracking)
- Consider implementing AI-powered task priority suggestions based on historical patterns
- Ensure the interface supports both keyboard shortcuts and touch interactions for efficiency
