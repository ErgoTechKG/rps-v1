# Story 198: Student Smart Notification System

## Overview

As a student, I need an intelligent notification system that filters, prioritizes, and contextualizes notifications based on my preferences, schedule, and current activities to reduce information overload while ensuring I never miss critical information.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As a student**, I want notifications to be automatically categorized by urgency and relevance so I can focus on what's most important without being overwhelmed.

2. **As a student**, I want to customize notification preferences for different types of events so I receive information through my preferred channels at appropriate times.

3. **As a student**, I want the system to learn from my interaction patterns and adjust notification timing to optimize my learning schedule.

4. **As a student**, I want contextual actions available directly in notifications so I can respond quickly without navigating to multiple screens.

### Secondary User Stories

5. **As a student**, I want to set "Do Not Disturb" periods during study sessions or classes so notifications don't interrupt my focus.
