# Story 350: Shared Quantum-Powered Optimization Engine

## Description
As any user, I want access to quantum-powered optimization capabilities that can solve complex scheduling, resource allocation, and matching problems that are computationally intensive for classical systems, so that I can achieve optimal solutions for multi-dimensional institutional challenges.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Multi-objective optimization with constraint satisfaction
- Resource allocation optimization across multiple dimensions
- Student-project matching with maximum satisfaction algorithms
- Course scheduling with conflict minimization and resource optimization
- Real-time optimization with quantum-classical hybrid approaches
- Scalable optimization for problems of varying complexity
- Integration with existing scheduling and resource management systems
- Performance benchmarking against classical optimization methods
- User-friendly interface for setting optimization parameters
- Fallback to classical methods when quantum resources unavailable
- Optimization result explanation and sensitivity analysis
