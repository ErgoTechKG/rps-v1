- [ ] **Rubric-Based Assessment**: Apply predefined rubrics to subjective assignments with AI assistance
- [ ] **Coding Assignment Evaluation**: Test and grade programming assignments automatically
- [ ] **Partial Credit Assignment**: Intelligently assign partial credit based on answer quality

### AI-Powered Analysis
- [ ] **Content Quality Assessment**: Analyze writing quality, structure, and adherence to requirements
- [ ] **Similarity Detection**: Identify potential plagiarism and academic integrity violations
- [ ] **AI Generation Detection**: Detect content that may have been generated by AI tools
- [ ] **Learning Objective Alignment**: Assess how well submissions meet learning objectives

### Consistency and Calibration
- [ ] **Grading Consistency Checks**: Flag inconsistencies in grading patterns across submissions
- [ ] **Calibration Assistance**: Help align grading with institutional standards and expectations
- [ ] **Bias Detection**: Identify potential grading biases and suggest corrections
- [ ] **Grade Distribution Analysis**: Analyze grade distributions and suggest adjustments

### Intelligent Feedback Generation
- [ ] **Automated Feedback**: Generate personalized feedback comments based on submission analysis
- [ ] **Improvement Suggestions**: Provide specific suggestions for student improvement
- [ ] **Template Comments**: Smart templates that adapt to submission content
- [ ] **Multi-language Support**: Support feedback generation in multiple languages

### Workflow Integration
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Process multiple assignments simultaneously with AI assistance
- [ ] **Review Queue**: Prioritize submissions that require human review
- [ ] **Confidence Scoring**: Provide AI confidence levels for automated assessments
- [ ] **Manual Override**: Easy override of AI suggestions with audit trail

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Accuracy Monitoring**: Track AI grading accuracy and improvement over time
- [ ] **Human Validation**: System for validating AI grading against human judgment
- [ ] **Model Training**: Continuously improve AI models based on professor feedback
- [ ] **Error Analysis**: Analyze and learn from grading errors
