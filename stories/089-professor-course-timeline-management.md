## Story Description
As a Professor, I want to have a comprehensive timeline management system for my courses so that I can set up phases, deadlines, and milestones with visual planning tools and template management.

## User Role

- [ ] Allow adjustment of phase durations by dragging timeline elements
- [ ] Support setting key time nodes and milestones
- [ ] Include buffer time configuration between phases
- [ ] Handle holiday and exception date processing

### Template Management
- [ ] Save current timeline configuration as template
- [ ] Load from historical timeline templates
- [ ] Share timeline templates with other professors
- [ ] Provide preset templates for common course structures

### Visual Planning Tools
