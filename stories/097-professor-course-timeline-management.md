# User Story 097: Professor Course Timeline Management

## Story Overview

**As a** Professor  
**I want** an advanced course timeline management system  
**So that** I can plan, visualize, and manage course schedules, deadlines, and milestones effectively throughout the academic term.

## Background

Course management involves complex scheduling of lectures, assignments, exams, and project milestones. The UI design specifies a comprehensive timeline management system that helps professors visualize course progression, manage dependencies, and ensure optimal pacing of academic content.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Timeline Interface
- [ ] **Interactive Course Timeline**: Drag-and-drop timeline interface for course planning
- [ ] **Gantt Chart View**: Project-style visualization of course components and dependencies
- [ ] **Calendar Integration**: Sync course timeline with calendar systems
- [ ] **Milestone Markers**: Visual indicators for key course milestones and deadlines

### Course Structure Planning
- [ ] **Module Organization**: Organize course content into logical modules and units
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Define prerequisites and relationships between topics
- [ ] **Pacing Optimization**: Automatically suggest optimal pacing based on content complexity
- [ ] **Template Library**: Pre-built timeline templates for common course types

### Assignment and Assessment Scheduling
- [ ] **Assignment Timeline**: Plan and schedule all course assignments and assessments
- [ ] **Workload Balancing**: Visualize student workload distribution across the term
- [ ] **Buffer Time Planning**: Include buffer periods for assignment completion and grading
- [ ] **Conflict Detection**: Identify potential scheduling conflicts with other courses

### Progress Tracking and Monitoring
- [ ] **Real-time Progress**: Track actual progress against planned timeline
- [ ] **Delay Management**: Identify delays and automatically suggest timeline adjustments
- [ ] **Student Progress Overlay**: Visualize individual student progress on course timeline
- [ ] **Performance Analytics**: Analyze timeline effectiveness and student outcomes

### Collaboration and Communication
- [ ] **Shared Timeline View**: Share timeline with students and teaching assistants
- [ ] **Timeline Notifications**: Automated notifications for upcoming deadlines and milestones
- [ ] **Change Management**: Track and communicate timeline changes to stakeholders
- [ ] **Feedback Integration**: Collect and incorporate feedback on timeline effectiveness

### Advanced Planning Features
- [ ] **Scenario Planning**: Create multiple timeline scenarios for comparison
- [ ] **Resource Allocation**: Plan resource needs (equipment, materials) along timeline
- [ ] **External Dependencies**: Manage dependencies on external factors (guest lectures, field trips)
- [ ] **Contingency Planning**: Built-in alternatives for timeline disruptions

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Implement interactive timeline visualization with drag-drop capabilities
- Create responsive Gantt chart component for course planning
- Design real-time progress tracking dashboard
- Build timeline sharing and collaboration interfaces

### Backend
- Develop timeline calculation and optimization algorithms
- Implement dependency management and conflict detection system
- Create notification and reminder scheduling engine
- Design analytics system for timeline performance tracking

### Database
- Create comprehensive course timeline and milestone schema
- Implement dependency tracking and relationship management
- Design progress tracking and historical data storage

### Integration
- Integrate with institutional calendar systems
- Connect with Learning Management Systems (LMS)
- Interface with student information systems for enrollment data

## Dependencies
- Story 008: Professor Topic Management (for course content context)
- Story 005: Shared Calendar System (for calendar integration)
- Story 016: Secretary Course Setup and Configuration (for course structure)
- Story 010: Professor Process Management (for workflow integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Interactive timeline interface supports complex course planning scenarios
- [ ] Dependency management correctly handles prerequisite relationships
- [ ] Progress tracking accurately reflects real-time course status
- [ ] Timeline sharing works seamlessly with students and assistants
- [ ] Analytics provide actionable insights for timeline optimization
- [ ] System handles semester-long courses with 50+ timeline items
- [ ] Mobile interface supports timeline viewing and basic modifications
- [ ] Integration testing completed with calendar and LMS systems

## Notes
- UI design emphasizes "时间线设置" (timeline setting) and "任务分配矩阵" (task assignment matrix)
- System should support "里程碑审核" (milestone review) functionality
- Consider implementing automatic timeline adjustment based on student feedback and performance
- Include visualization of "工作负荷" (workload) distribution to prevent student overload
- Ensure timeline system supports both traditional and innovative course formats
