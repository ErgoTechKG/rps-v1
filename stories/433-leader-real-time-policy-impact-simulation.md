## Title
Leader Real-Time Policy Impact Simulation

## Role
Leader

## Description
As a leader, I need a real-time policy impact simulation system that allows me to model the effects of proposed policies, regulations, and strategic decisions across multiple scenarios before implementation, ensuring evidence-based decision making.

## Background
The UI design specifications (leader-ui.md lines 477-624) describe an advanced policy simulation system that uses predictive modeling, scenario analysis, and real-time data to forecast the impact of institutional policies and strategic decisions across various operational dimensions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Provide template-based policy creation with parameter customization
- [ ] Enable complex multi-variable policy scenarios with interdependencies
- [ ] Support both short-term and long-term impact modeling

### Simulation and Scenario Analysis
- [ ] Run real-time simulations using institutional historical data
- [ ] Support Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty analysis
- [ ] Provide sensitivity analysis for key policy parameters
- [ ] Enable comparative analysis of multiple policy alternatives

### Impact Visualization and Analytics
- [ ] Display simulation results through interactive dashboards
- [ ] Provide multi-dimensional impact visualization (financial, academic, operational)
- [ ] Show confidence intervals and uncertainty ranges
- [ ] Generate heatmaps for impact intensity across different areas

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- [ ] Identify potential risks and unintended consequences
- [ ] Provide risk probability and impact scoring
- [ ] Suggest mitigation strategies for identified risks
- [ ] Enable stress testing under extreme scenarios

### Decision Support and Documentation
- [ ] Generate comprehensive impact assessment reports
- [ ] Provide evidence-based recommendations for policy decisions
- [ ] Support collaborative review with stakeholder input
- [ ] Document assumptions and methodology for transparency
