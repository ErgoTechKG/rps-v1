- Local data storage with automatic sync
- Offline mode for critical features
- Edge server deployment in remote regions
- Background sync when connection restored
- Conflict resolution for offline edits
- Offline capability indicators in UI
- Download content for offline access
- Queue actions performed offline

## Technical Requirements
- Service Worker implementation
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Sync API for background synchronization
- Edge server infrastructure
- Caching strategies for static assets
- Offline-first data architecture
- Network status detection

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clear offline/online status indicators
- Sync status notifications
- Offline mode UI adaptations
- Download progress indicators
- Conflict resolution interface

## Dependencies
- PWA framework setup
- Edge infrastructure deployment
- Local storage implementation

## Roles Affected
