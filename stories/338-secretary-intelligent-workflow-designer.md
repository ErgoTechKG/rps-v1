# Story 338: Secretary Intelligent Workflow Designer with Visual Automation

## Title
Secretary Intelligent Workflow Designer with Drag-and-Drop Visual Automation

## Role
Secretary

## Category
Process Automation

## Priority
Medium

## Description
Implement a sophisticated visual workflow designer that enables secretaries to create, modify, and manage automated processes through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface without requiring programming knowledge. The system includes workflow templates, execution monitoring, and intelligent optimization suggestions.

## User Story
As a secretary (科研秘书), I want a visual workflow designer with drag-and-drop functionality so that I can create and automate complex administrative processes without programming knowledge while monitoring their execution and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Workflow Designer Interface
- [ ] Drag-and-drop canvas for building workflows
- [ ] Component palette with workflow building blocks:
  - Trigger events (time-based, data-based, user-initiated)
  - Action nodes (send notification, update database, generate report)
  - Decision points (conditional logic, approval gates)
  - Integration connectors (external systems, APIs)
  - Parallel processing and synchronization points
- [ ] Visual connection lines showing workflow flow
- [ ] Real-time validation of workflow logic and dependencies

### Workflow Template Library
- [ ] Pre-built workflow templates for common processes:
  - Student application processing pipeline
  - Course deadline reminder automation
  - Data collection and synchronization workflows
  - Report generation and distribution processes
  - Conflict detection and resolution protocols
- [ ] Template customization with parameter configuration
- [ ] Community sharing of successful workflow patterns
- [ ] Version control for workflow templates

### Workflow Configuration and Setup
- [ ] Parameter configuration panels for each workflow component
- [ ] Conditional logic builder with visual rule definition
- [ ] Schedule configuration for time-based triggers
- [ ] Permission and access control settings
- [ ] Error handling and retry configuration
- [ ] Notification and escalation setup

### Execution Monitoring and Management
- [ ] Real-time workflow execution dashboard
- [ ] Visual progress tracking through workflow steps
- [ ] Error detection and alert system
- [ ] Performance metrics and execution analytics
- [ ] Manual intervention and override capabilities
- [ ] Workflow pause, resume, and emergency stop functions

### Intelligent Optimization Features
- [ ] AI-powered workflow optimization suggestions:
  - Bottleneck identification and resolution
  - Performance improvement recommendations
  - Resource utilization optimization
  - Parallel processing opportunities
- [ ] Automated testing and validation of workflows
- [ ] A/B testing capabilities for workflow variants
- [ ] Machine learning insights from execution patterns

### Integration and Connectivity
- [ ] API connectors for external systems integration
- [ ] Database query and update capabilities
- [ ] Email and notification service integration
- [ ] File system and document management connections
- [ ] Calendar and scheduling system integration
- [ ] Custom script execution for complex logic

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Canvas-based workflow designer using libraries like React Flow or D3.js
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Real-time collaboration capabilities for team workflow design
- Accessibility features for diverse users

### Backend
- Workflow execution engine with state management
- Visual workflow definition storage and retrieval
- Integration APIs for external system connections
- Monitoring and analytics data collection

### Database
- Workflow definition storage with versioning
- Execution history and performance metrics
- Template library with metadata and ratings
- User permissions and access control data

### Performance
- Smooth drag-and-drop interactions without lag
- Efficient workflow execution with minimal resource usage
- Scalable architecture for concurrent workflow execution
- Real-time monitoring updates with minimal latency

## Dependencies
- 016 (Secretary Course Setup and Configuration)
- 018 (Secretary Process Monitoring)
- 043 (Secretary User Management)
- 082 (Secretary Advanced Workflow Automation)

## Estimated Effort
Extra Large (15-20 story points)

## Notes
This story addresses the visual workflow automation capabilities mentioned in secretary-ui.md lines 834-866 and the workflow engine framework described in DESIGN.md lines 869-910, providing secretaries with powerful process automation tools through an intuitive visual interface that eliminates the need for programming expertise while enabling sophisticated workflow management and optimization.
