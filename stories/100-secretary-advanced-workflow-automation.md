# User Story 100: Secretary Advanced Workflow Automation

## Story Overview

**As a** Secretary  
**I want** advanced workflow automation capabilities  
**So that** I can automate repetitive administrative tasks, ensure consistent process execution, and focus on higher-value activities that require human judgment.

## Background

Administrative work involves many repetitive processes that can be automated to improve efficiency and reduce errors. The UI design specifies comprehensive workflow automation tools that help secretaries create, manage, and monitor automated processes for various administrative tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Workflow Design and Creation
- [ ] **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating automated workflows
- [ ] **Process Templates**: Pre-built templates for common administrative processes
- [ ] **Conditional Logic**: Support for if-then-else conditions and branching workflows
- [ ] **Multi-step Processes**: Complex workflows with multiple stages and approvals

### Task Automation
- [ ] **Data Entry Automation**: Automatic data collection and entry from various sources
- [ ] **Document Generation**: Automated creation of reports, letters, and certificates
- [ ] **Email Automation**: Scheduled and triggered email communications
- [ ] **Notification Management**: Automated reminder and alert systems

### Process Monitoring and Control
- [ ] **Workflow Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of all active automated processes
- [ ] **Process Status Tracking**: Detailed status information for each workflow instance
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Automatic error detection and recovery procedures
- [ ] **Manual Intervention**: Ability to pause, modify, or manually complete workflows

### Integration Capabilities
- [ ] **System Integrations**: Connect workflows with various institutional systems
- [ ] **API Connections**: Integration with external services and databases
- [ ] **File Processing**: Automated handling of documents and file transfers
- [ ] **Calendar Integration**: Automated scheduling and calendar management

### Approval and Review Processes
- [ ] **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval processes with routing rules
- [ ] **Review Queues**: Automated distribution of items requiring human review
- [ ] **Escalation Procedures**: Automatic escalation for overdue approvals
- [ ] **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all workflow activities

### Performance and Analytics
- [ ] **Process Metrics**: Track workflow performance, completion times, and efficiency
- [ ] **Bottleneck Identification**: Identify and analyze workflow bottlenecks
- [ ] **Success Rate Monitoring**: Monitor workflow success rates and failure patterns
- [ ] **ROI Analysis**: Calculate time and cost savings from automation

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Implement visual workflow designer with drag-drop functionality
- Create workflow monitoring dashboard with real-time updates
- Design process analytics and reporting interface
- Build workflow testing and simulation tools

### Backend
- Develop workflow execution engine with robust error handling
- Implement scheduling and trigger management system
- Create integration framework for external systems and APIs
- Design audit logging and performance tracking system

### Database

## Dependencies
- Story 016: Secretary Course Setup and Configuration (for process context)
- Story 018: Secretary Process Monitoring (for monitoring integration)
- Story 043: Secretary User Management (for user context in workflows)
- Story 004: Notification System (for automated communications)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Visual workflow builder supports complex multi-step process design
- [ ] Workflow execution engine handles concurrent processes reliably
- [ ] Integration framework connects with institutional systems successfully
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms work effectively
- [ ] Analytics provide meaningful insights into workflow performance
- [ ] System scales to handle 100+ concurrent workflow instances
- [ ] Security testing validates safe handling of sensitive automated processes

## Notes
- UI design emphasizes "自动化数据同步减少手工录入" (automated data synchronization reduces manual entry)
- System should support "一键式报告生成工具" (one-click report generation tools)
- Consider implementing AI-powered workflow optimization suggestions
- Include approval workflow capabilities for document and process management
- Ensure system maintains compliance with institutional policies and procedures
