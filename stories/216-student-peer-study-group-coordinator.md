# Story 216: Student Peer Study Group Coordinator

## Title
Student Peer Study Group Coordinator for Intelligent Collaborative Learning

## Story
As a student, I want a peer study group coordinator so that I can be matched with compatible study partners, participate in effective collaborative learning sessions, and access intelligent group formation and management tools that enhance my learning outcomes through peer interaction.

## Background
Students benefit significantly from peer learning and study groups, but forming effective groups requires matching compatible learning styles, schedules, academic levels, and study goals. An intelligent coordinator can optimize group formation and provide tools for successful collaboration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Schedule compatibility analysis for optimal meeting time identification
- [ ] Goal alignment assessment to ensure group members have compatible learning objectives
- [ ] Diversity balancing for heterogeneous groups that promote mutual learning
- [ ] Dynamic group adjustment based on performance and satisfaction feedback

### Collaborative Learning Tools
- [ ] Shared study space with document collaboration and resource sharing capabilities
- [ ] Virtual meeting integration with screen sharing and interactive whiteboard features
- [ ] Progress tracking for group goals and individual contribution monitoring
- [ ] Study session planning with agenda creation and time management tools
- [ ] Peer assessment and feedback systems for continuous improvement

### Group Management Features
- [ ] Communication hub with messaging, announcements, and discussion forums
- [ ] Role assignment and responsibility tracking for different group functions
- [ ] Conflict resolution tools with mediation suggestions and escalation procedures
- [ ] Group performance analytics with learning outcome measurement and improvement recommendations
- [ ] Integration with course assignments and exam preparation schedules

### Social Learning Enhancement
- [ ] Knowledge sharing platform with peer-generated content and explanations
- [ ] Study technique exchange with effectiveness rating and recommendation systems
- [ ] Mentorship connections between advanced and beginner students
- [ ] Achievement recognition and gamification elements for group participation
- [ ] Cross-group networking for broader peer learning community building
