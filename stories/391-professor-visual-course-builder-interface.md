# Story 391: Professor Visual Course Builder Interface

## Description

As a professor, I want a sophisticated visual course builder interface that allows me to design course structures using drag-and-drop components, so that I can create engaging and well-organized courses without technical expertise.

## User Story

**As a** professor  
**I want** a visual course builder with drag-and-drop functionality  
**So that** I can design course structures intuitively and create engaging learning experiences

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Course Design Interface
- [ ] Drag-and-drop course component library (lectures, assignments, labs, discussions)
- [ ] Visual timeline for organizing course content chronologically
- [ ] Real-time preview of course structure as students will see it
- [ ] Template library with pre-built course structures
- [ ] Component dependency mapping and prerequisite visualization

### Content Management
- [ ] Rich media content integration (videos, documents, interactive elements)
- [ ] Bulk content upload and organization tools
- [ ] Version control for course content with rollback capabilities
- [ ] Content sharing and collaboration with other professors
- [ ] Automated content validation and quality checks

### Assessment Integration
- [ ] Assessment component designer with various question types
- [ ] Rubric builder with visual weight distribution
- [ ] Automated grading configuration for standardized assessments
- [ ] Progress tracking milestone placement throughout course timeline
- [ ] Integration with existing grading systems

### Customization and Personalization
- [ ] Theme and layout customization options
- [ ] Student path customization based on performance or interests
- [ ] Adaptive content delivery based on learning analytics
- [ ] Multi-language content support
- [ ] Accessibility features configuration

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
- React-based drag-and-drop interface using react-beautiful-dnd
- Canvas-based visual timeline with zoom and pan capabilities
- Real-time preview rendering engine
- Component palette with search and categorization
- Undo/redo functionality with command pattern

### Backend Integration
- Course structure API with versioning support
- Content management service integration
- Template storage and retrieval system
- Collaboration features with real-time synchronization
- Export capabilities to standard formats (SCORM, QTI)

### Database Schema
```sql
course_builder_templates
course_components
course_structure_versions
component_dependencies
shared_resources
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/professor/courses/{courseId}/builder/save
GET /api/professor/courses/{courseId}/builder/load
POST /api/professor/courses/builder/templates
GET /api/professor/courses/builder/components
PUT /api/professor/courses/{courseId}/builder/publish
```

## Dependencies
- Story 008: Professor Topic Management
- Story 049: Shared Document Management System
- Story 007: User Profile Management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Visual course builder interface implemented with full drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Template system with library of pre-built course structures
- [ ] Real-time preview and collaboration features working
- [ ] Integration with existing course management systems complete
- [ ] Comprehensive testing including usability testing with professors
- [ ] Documentation and training materials created
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance optimization for large course structures completed

## Notes
This story addresses the sophisticated visual course design interface described in professor-ui.md that goes beyond basic topic management to provide a comprehensive course building environment with advanced features for content organization, assessment design, and adaptive learning path creation.
