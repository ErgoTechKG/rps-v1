# Story 362: Secretary Visual Workflow Automation Designer

## Title
Drag-and-Drop Workflow Creation with Intelligent Automation

## Description
As a Secretary, I need a visual workflow automation designer with drag-and-drop capabilities, process mapping tools, and intelligent automation suggestions to create and manage complex workflows without requiring technical programming skills.

## Actors
- Secretary (Primary)
- Department Staff
- System Administrator
- Workflow Participants

## Preconditions
- Secretary has workflow creation rights
- Workflow components are available
- Integration points configured
- Automation rules defined

## Postconditions
- Workflows created visually
- Automations implemented
- Processes standardized
- Efficiency improved

## Normal Flow
1. Secretary accesses Workflow Designer
2. System displays visual canvas:
   - Component palette
   - Blank workflow space
   - Template library
   - Recent workflows
3. Secretary drags components onto canvas:
   - Start/End nodes
   - Action blocks
   - Decision points
   - Integration connectors
   - Notification triggers
4. Visual connections created:
   - Drag between components
   - Auto-routing paths
   - Conditional branches
   - Parallel processes
5. Component configuration:
   - Double-click to edit
   - Form fields appear
   - Validation rules set
   - Data mappings defined
6. AI suggests improvements:
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Common patterns
   - Error prevention
   - Efficiency gains
7. Real-time validation:
   - Syntax checking
   - Logic verification
   - Permission validation
   - Integration testing
8. Workflow testing mode:
   - Simulated execution
   - Step-by-step debugging
   - Data flow preview
   - Performance metrics
9. Secretary publishes workflow
10. Automation begins operation

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Template Customization
1. At step 2, Secretary selects template
2. Pre-built workflow loads
3. Secretary modifies components
4. Template-specific guidance shown
5. Customizations validated
6. New template saved
7. Flow continues from step 6

### Alternative Flow 2: Collaborative Design
1. At step 3, Secretary invites collaborators
2. Real-time multi-user editing
3. Changes synchronized
4. Comments and annotations
5. Version control active
6. Consensus approval required
7. Flow continues from step 9

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: Integration Failure
1. At step 7, external system unavailable
2. Designer highlights issue
3. Alternative paths suggested
4. Manual fallback configured
5. Retry logic added
6. Workflow adapted

### Exception 2: Complex Logic Required
1. At step 5, visual tools insufficient
2. Advanced mode activated
3. Code editor appears
4. Secretary gets IT help
5. Custom function created
6. Visual wrapper generated

## Business Rules
- No coding required for 90% of workflows
- All workflows must have error handling
- Approval chains follow org hierarchy
- Data privacy rules enforced
- Audit trails automatically created

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Canvas renders smoothly with 100+ nodes
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Undo/redo up to 50 actions
- Export to standard formats
- Responsive on tablets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Drag-and-drop creates valid workflows
- [ ] Visual connections route intelligently
- [ ] AI suggestions improve efficiency
- [ ] Testing mode catches errors
- [ ] Non-technical users succeed
- [ ] Published workflows execute reliably
- [ ] Performance remains smooth

## Technical Notes
- React Flow for visual editor
- Node-based workflow engine
- WebSocket for collaboration
- Kubernetes for execution
- OpenAPI for integrations

## UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive component icons
- Clear visual feedback
- Contextual help panels
- Zoom and pan controls
- Grid snapping options
- Print-friendly layouts

## Dependencies
- Stories: 082, 016, 018, 043
- Workflow execution engine
- Integration middleware
- Form builder system
- Notification service

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Visual complexity overwhelming
  - **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure and tutorials
- **Risk**: Poor performance with large workflows
  - **Mitigation**: Virtualization and lazy loading
- **Risk**: Integration security concerns
  - **Mitigation**: Sandboxed execution environment

## Assumptions
- Secretaries prefer visual tools
- Common patterns exist
- Integrations are stable
- Training is provided
