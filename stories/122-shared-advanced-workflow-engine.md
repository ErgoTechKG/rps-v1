# Story 122: Shared Advanced Workflow Engine

## Description
As a **User of any role**, I want access to an advanced workflow engine that can automate complex multi-step processes, handle dynamic workflows, and provide intelligent process optimization so that routine tasks are automated and complex workflows are managed efficiently across all system functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Workflow Design and Configuration
- [ ] I can create custom workflows using a visual drag-and-drop interface
- [ ] I can define workflow steps with conditional logic and branching
- [ ] I can set up approval processes with multiple stakeholders and routing rules
- [ ] I can configure automatic escalation and timeout handling

### Dynamic Workflow Execution
- [ ] I can trigger workflows based on events, schedules, or manual actions
- [ ] I can monitor workflow progress in real-time with visual status indicators
- [ ] I can handle exceptions and errors with defined fallback procedures
- [ ] I can pause, resume, or modify running workflows when needed

### Intelligent Process Optimization
- [ ] I can receive AI-powered suggestions for workflow improvements
- [ ] I can analyze workflow performance metrics and bottleneck identification
- [ ] I can automatically optimize workflow routing based on performance data
- [ ] I can predict workflow completion times and resource requirements

### Integration and Extensibility
- [ ] I can integrate workflows with external systems via APIs
- [ ] I can create reusable workflow templates for common processes
- [ ] I can share workflow components across different departments
- [ ] I can version control workflows and roll back to previous versions

### Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] I can view comprehensive workflow analytics and performance dashboards
- [ ] I can track SLA compliance and process efficiency metrics
- [ ] I can generate reports on workflow utilization and outcomes
- [ ] I can set up alerts for workflow failures or performance issues

## User Stories

### Process Automation
```
As a Professor
I want to automate the student selection workflow
So that applications are processed consistently and efficiently
```

### Workflow Monitoring
```
As a Secretary
I want to monitor all active workflows in real-time
So that I can identify bottlenecks and ensure timely completion
```

### Process Optimization
```
As a Leader
I want to analyze workflow performance across departments
So that I can identify opportunities for process improvement
```

## Technical Requirements

### Workflow Engine
- Visual workflow designer with intuitive interface
- Robust execution engine with error handling
- Support for parallel and sequential process flows
- Integration with existing authentication and authorization

### Performance and Scalability
- Efficient handling of high-volume workflow execution
- Scalable architecture for enterprise-level usage
- Real-time monitoring with minimal performance impact
- Backup and recovery capabilities for workflow data

### Integration Architecture
- RESTful APIs for external system integration
- Webhook support for event-driven workflows
- Database integration for data-driven processes
- Email and notification system integration

## Dependencies
- User Authentication (Story 001)
- Notification System (Story 004)
- Document Management System (Story 049)
- Secretary Advanced Workflow Automation (Story 082)

## Acceptance Tests

### Workflow Creation Test
```
Given I have permission to create workflows
When I design a multi-step approval process
Then I should be able to define conditions, approvers, and escalation rules
And test the workflow before deployment
```

### Dynamic Execution Test
```
Given I have an active workflow with conditional branches
When the workflow encounters different conditions
Then it should route correctly based on the defined logic
And maintain accurate status tracking
```

### Performance Analytics Test
```
Given I have multiple workflows running over time
When I access the analytics dashboard
Then I should see performance metrics, bottleneck analysis, and optimization suggestions
And be able to export detailed reports
```

## Notes
- This story provides the advanced workflow capabilities referenced across multiple UI documents
- Enables sophisticated process automation that benefits all user roles
- Supports the extensible workflow framework mentioned in DESIGN.md
- Provides the foundation for complex institutional process management and optimization
