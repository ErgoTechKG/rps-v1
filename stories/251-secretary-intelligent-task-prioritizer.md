# Story 251: Secretary Intelligent Task Prioritization Engine

## Description
As a secretary, I want an intelligent task prioritization engine that automatically assigns priority levels and urgency indicators to tasks so that I can efficiently manage workload, ensure critical tasks receive immediate attention, and optimize resource allocation across multiple concurrent projects.

## User Story
```
As a secretary
I want automated task prioritization with intelligent urgency indicators
So that I can efficiently manage workload and ensure critical tasks receive immediate attention
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Intelligent Priority Assignment
- [ ] Automatically categorize tasks by urgency (üî¥ Á¥ßÊÄ•, ‚ö†Ô∏è ÈáçË¶Å, üìã Â∏∏ËßÑ)
- [ ] Consider multiple factors: deadlines, stakeholder importance, project impact, dependencies
- [ ] Assign numerical priority scores (1-10) with explanation
- [ ] Update priorities dynamically as conditions change
- [ ] Learn from secretary adjustments to improve algorithm

### Dynamic Task Categorization
- [ ] Sort tasks into categories: ÂæÖÂ§ÑÁêÜ (pending), ËøõË°å‰∏≠ (in progress), Â∑≤ÈÄæÊúü (overdue), Â∑≤ÂÆåÊàê (completed)
- [ ] Show task counts in each category with visual indicators
- [ ] Provide drill-down capabilities for detailed task lists
- [ ] Support custom category creation for specific workflows
- [ ] Enable bulk task status updates and reassignment

### Urgency Detection System
- [ ] Identify approaching deadlines with countdown timers
- [ ] Flag tasks requiring immediate escalation (24-hour urgency)
- [ ] Detect dependency conflicts that could cause delays
- [ ] Monitor resource availability for task completion
- [ ] Alert on stakeholder escalation requirements

### Visual Priority Dashboard
- [ ] Display color-coded priority heat map
- [ ] Show task distribution across priority levels
- [ ] Provide timeline view of urgent tasks
- [ ] Include workload capacity indicators
- [ ] Support filtering and sorting by multiple criteria

### Automation and Workflow Features
- [ ] Auto-assign tasks based on skills and availability
- [ ] Generate recommended daily task schedules
- [ ] Suggest task delegation opportunities
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks and resource constraints
- [ ] Provide workload balancing recommendations

### Reporting and Analytics
- [ ] Track task completion rates by priority level
- [ ] Generate productivity reports and trends
- [ ] Identify patterns in task urgency and timing
- [ ] Measure impact of prioritization on overall efficiency
- [ ] Provide insights for process improvement

## Technical Requirements
- Machine learning algorithms for priority prediction
- Real-time task monitoring and status updates
- Integration with calendar and project management systems
- Mobile notifications for urgent task alerts
- Analytics dashboard with customizable reports

## Dependencies
- Story 018: Secretary Process Monitoring
- Story 004: Notification System
- Story 019: Secretary Data Collection
- Story 041: Secretary AI Insights

## Business Value
- Improves task completion efficiency by 40%
- Reduces missed deadlines and escalations
- Optimizes secretary workload and stress management
- Enhances stakeholder satisfaction with timely responses
- Provides data-driven insights for workflow optimization

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clear visual hierarchy with color-coded priority indicators
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for priority adjustments
- Quick-action buttons for common task operations
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go task management
- Customizable dashboard layouts for different work styles

## Acceptance Definition
The story is complete when secretaries can access automatically prioritized task lists with intelligent urgency indicators, adjust priorities with machine learning feedback, manage tasks efficiently through visual dashboards, and benefit from workload optimization recommendations that improve overall productivity and deadline adherence.
