- API endpoint response time monitoring with alerts
- Database query performance analyzer with slow query detection
- Resource utilization tracking (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Automated scaling triggers based on performance thresholds
- Historical performance data with trend analysis
- Customizable alerts for performance degradation
- Integration with existing monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)

## Technical Requirements
- Performance monitoring infrastructure
- Metrics collection and aggregation system
- Real-time alerting mechanism
- Data visualization components
- API for accessing performance metrics
- Automated reporting capabilities

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, intuitive performance dashboard
- Real-time metric updates
- Mobile-responsive monitoring interface
- Customizable widget layouts
- Export capabilities for reports

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure setup
- Monitoring tool integration
- Alert notification system

## Roles Affected
- System Administrators (primary)
- Leaders (performance reports)
- All roles (indirectly through improved performance)
