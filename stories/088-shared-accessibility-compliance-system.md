# Story 088: Shared Accessibility Compliance System

## User Story
As a **system user with disabilities**, I want the platform to be fully accessible and compliant with international accessibility standards so that I can use all features effectively regardless of my physical or cognitive abilities.

## Background
The shared UI design document emphasizes comprehensive accessibility features including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and inclusive design principles. This story ensures full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across the entire platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- [ ] All color contrasts meet minimum 4.5:1 ratio requirements
- [ ] Large text maintains 3:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] All interactive elements have 3:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] Color is not the only method for conveying information

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] All functionality is accessible via keyboard only
- [ ] Logical tab order throughout all interfaces
- [ ] Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for frequently used functions
- [ ] Escape key functionality for closing modals and menus

### Screen Reader Support
- [ ] Semantic HTML markup for proper content structure
- [ ] ARIA labels and descriptions for complex interfaces
- [ ] Alternative text for all images and graphics
- [ ] Screen reader testing with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy throughout all pages

### Motor Accessibility
- [ ] Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile interfaces
- [ ] Extended timeout options for time-sensitive actions
- [ ] Click targets have adequate spacing
- [ ] Drag and drop alternatives for all interactions
- [ ] Support for speech recognition software

### Cognitive Accessibility
- [ ] Clear and simple language throughout interfaces
- [ ] Consistent navigation and interaction patterns
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive and helpful
- [ ] Optional animations with user control
- [ ] Simplified interface modes available

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details
- Implement comprehensive ARIA attributes
- Build automated accessibility testing pipeline
- Create accessibility testing tools and checklists
- Develop alternative interaction methods

### Testing and Validation
- Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual testing with actual assistive technologies
- User testing with disabled users
- Regular accessibility audits by third-party experts

### Performance Requirements
- Accessibility features don't impact page load times
- Screen reader compatibility maintains smooth interaction
- Keyboard navigation is responsive and immediate
- Alternative text loads quickly with images

### Security Considerations
- Accessibility features don't expose additional security vulnerabilities
- Screen reader content doesn't reveal sensitive information
- Alternative interaction methods maintain security protocols

## Dependencies
- Story 001: User Authentication (for accessible login)
- Story 003: Shared Navigation System (for accessible navigation)
- Story 079: Shared Design System Management (for accessible components)

## Mockups/Wireframes
Reference: ui-ux/shared-ui.md accessibility section (lines 297-318)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified by automated testing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works flawlessly across all interfaces
- [ ] Screen reader support tested and optimized
- [ ] Motor accessibility features are functional
- [ ] Cognitive accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Third-party accessibility audit passes
- [ ] User testing with disabled users shows successful usage
