# Story 132: Professor Course Timeline Management

## Overview
As a professor, I want a comprehensive course timeline management system that allows me to visually plan, adjust, and monitor all course phases and deadlines, so that I can ensure smooth course progression and proactive deadline management.

## User Story
**As a** professor managing lab rotation courses
**I want** a visual course timeline management system
**So that** I can efficiently plan course phases, adjust deadlines, and track progress across multiple cohorts

## Background
From the professor-ui.md design (lines 89-91), professors need sophisticated timeline management tools beyond basic scheduling. The UI design shows needs for visual timeline editing, phase management, and integrated deadline tracking that goes beyond current basic course management features.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Visual Timeline Editor
- **Given** I am managing a course timeline
- **When** I access the timeline management interface
- **Then** I should see:
  - Gantt chart-style visual timeline
  - Drag-and-drop phase adjustment
  - Color-coded phases (setup, application, matching, execution, evaluation)
  - Dependency lines between phases
  - Critical path highlighting

### 2. Phase Template Management
- **Given** I am setting up a new course timeline
- **When** I create or modify phases
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - Use predefined phase templates
  - Create custom phase templates
  - Set phase durations and dependencies
  - Define phase-specific requirements and deliverables
  - Save templates for future course iterations

### 3. Dynamic Timeline Adjustment
- **Given** I need to modify course timeline
- **When** I adjust phase dates or durations
- **Then** the system should:
  - Automatically adjust dependent phases
  - Show impact analysis of changes
  - Warn about conflicts with academic calendar
  - Update all student and stakeholder deadlines
  - Generate change notification summaries

### 4. Multi-Course Timeline Coordination
- **Given** I am managing multiple course sections
- **When** I view my overall teaching schedule
- **Then** I should see:
  - Unified timeline view across all my courses
  - Resource conflict detection
  - Workload distribution visualization
  - Cross-course dependency management
  - Optimal scheduling recommendations

### 5. Milestone and Deadline Tracking
- **Given** I have set course milestones
- **When** I monitor course progress
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - Track completion rates for each milestone
  - View student progress against deadlines
  - Receive early warning for at-risk students
  - Generate progress reports for different stakeholders
  - Set up automated reminder sequences

### 6. Resource Allocation Timeline
- **Given** I need to coordinate course resources
- **When** I plan resource usage
- **Then** I should be able to:
  - Map lab/equipment bookings to timeline
  - Schedule guest lectures and external events
  - Coordinate with other faculty members
  - Track resource availability and conflicts
  - Integrate with institutional scheduling systems

### 7. Historical Timeline Analytics
- **Given** I want to improve future course planning
- **When** I review past course timelines
- **Then** I should see:
  - Historical timeline performance data
  - Phase duration optimization insights
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Success rate correlations with timeline factors
  - Comparative analysis across different cohorts

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements
- Interactive timeline visualization library (e.g., vis-timeline)
- Real-time collaboration for multi-instructor courses
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Automated notification system
- Data analytics for timeline optimization

### UI Components
- Drag-and-drop timeline interface
- Phase configuration panels
- Resource allocation calendar
- Progress tracking dashboards
- Timeline template library

### Data Model
```
CourseTimeline {
  id, courseId, professorId, academicYear,
  phases: [PhaseDefinition],
  milestones: [Milestone],
  resources: [ResourceAllocation],
  dependencies: [Dependency],
  lastModified, version
}

PhaseDefinition {
  id, name, startDate, endDate, description,
  requirements, deliverables, dependencies,
  resources, color, isTemplate
}
```

## Dependencies
- Story 008: Professor Topic Management (for course setup)
- Story 016: Secretary Course Setup and Configuration (for institutional coordination)
- Story 005: Shared Calendar System (for calendar integration)
- Story 004: Notification System (for timeline alerts)

## Priority
High - Essential for effective course management and coordination

## Notes
- Should integrate with academic calendar systems
- Needs to support different course types and structures
- Should provide mobile access for timeline monitoring
- Consider integration with project management tools
