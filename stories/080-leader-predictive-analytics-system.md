# Story 080: Leader Predictive Analytics System

## User Story
As a **leader**, I want to access predictive analytics and trend forecasting capabilities so that I can make proactive decisions and anticipate future challenges in the research program.

## Background
The leader UI design includes advanced predictive analysis features that go beyond basic reporting. This system should provide trend forecasting, scenario modeling, and early warning systems for strategic decision-making.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Trend Prediction
- [ ] Historical data analysis generates accurate trend predictions
- [ ] Confidence intervals are displayed for all predictions
- [ ] Multiple forecasting models are available (linear, exponential, seasonal)
- [ ] Prediction accuracy metrics are tracked and displayed

### Scenario Modeling
- [ ] "What-if" scenarios can be created and analyzed
- [ ] Resource allocation impact can be modeled
- [ ] Policy change effects can be simulated
- [ ] Risk assessment models are available

### Early Warning System
- [ ] Threshold-based alerts for key performance indicators
- [ ] Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns
- [ ] Automated notifications for critical trend changes
- [ ] Escalation procedures for different alert levels

### Risk Forecasting
- [ ] Student performance risk prediction
- [ ] Resource shortage forecasting
- [ ] Faculty workload imbalance prediction
- [ ] Budget overrun early detection

### Visualization and Reporting
- [ ] Interactive charts show trend lines with confidence bands
- [ ] Scenario comparison visualizations
- [ ] Risk heat maps and probability matrices
- [ ] Executive summary reports with key insights

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details
- Implement time series analysis algorithms (ARIMA, Prophet, etc.)
- Create machine learning models for pattern recognition
- Build interactive visualization components
- Develop automated alert system

### Data Requirements
- Historical data spanning at least 2 years for accurate predictions
- Real-time data feeds for continuous model updates
- External data integration for broader context
- Data quality validation and cleaning pipelines

### Performance Requirements
- Prediction calculations complete within 30 seconds
- Real-time alerts triggered within 5 minutes of threshold breach
- Dashboard loads prediction data in under 3 seconds
- Batch prediction jobs complete within 1 hour

### Security Considerations
- Prediction models don't expose individual student data
- Scenario analysis maintains data privacy
- Access controls for sensitive predictive information
- Audit trails for all prediction requests

## Dependencies
- Story 020: Leader Executive Overview (for base dashboard)
- Story 042: Leader AI Report Generation (for AI capabilities)
- Story 047: Advanced Analytics and Reporting (for data foundation)

## Mockups/Wireframes
Reference: ui-ux/leader-ui.md predictive analysis section (lines 247-260)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Predictive models are trained and validated
- [ ] Trend forecasting interface is operational
- [ ] Scenario modeling tools are available
- [ ] Early warning system sends accurate alerts
- [ ] Prediction accuracy meets 80% threshold
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are achieved
- [ ] Security and privacy requirements are met
