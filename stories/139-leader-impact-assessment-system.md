# Story 139: Leader Impact Assessment System

As a **Leader**, I want an advanced impact assessment system so that I can evaluate the potential effects of policy changes and strategic decisions before implementation, ensuring data-driven institutional management.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Policy Impact Simulation
- [ ] I can model the potential effects of policy changes on different stakeholder groups
- [ ] I can simulate budget allocation changes and see projected outcomes
- [ ] I can assess the impact of curriculum modifications on student success metrics
- [ ] I can preview the effects of resource redistribution across departments

### Scenario Planning
- [ ] I can create "what-if" scenarios for major institutional decisions
- [ ] I can compare multiple policy options side-by-side with projected outcomes
- [ ] I can model both short-term and long-term implications of decisions
- [ ] I can assess risk levels associated with different strategic choices

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis
- [ ] I can see how proposed changes will affect students, faculty, and staff
- [ ] I can identify which groups will benefit most or be most challenged by changes
- [ ] I can assess workload impacts on different roles and departments
- [ ] I can evaluate equity implications of proposed policies

### Data-Driven Recommendations
- [ ] The system provides evidence-based recommendations for optimal outcomes
- [ ] I can see historical data about similar decisions and their results
- [ ] I can access best practice examples from comparable institutions
- [ ] I can view confidence intervals and uncertainty measures for projections

### Implementation Planning
- [ ] I can generate implementation roadmaps based on impact assessments
- [ ] I can identify critical success factors and potential failure points
- [ ] I can plan resource requirements for successful policy implementation
- [ ] I can establish monitoring metrics to track actual vs. projected impacts

## Business Value
- Reduces risk of unintended consequences from policy changes
- Improves strategic decision quality through evidence-based analysis
- Enables proactive identification of implementation challenges
- Supports transparent and accountable institutional governance
