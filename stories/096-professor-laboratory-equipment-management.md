# User Story 096: Professor Laboratory Equipment Management

## Story Overview

**As a** Professor  
**I want** a comprehensive laboratory equipment management system  
**So that** I can efficiently track, reserve, and manage laboratory resources and equipment for my research and teaching activities.

## Background

Laboratory-based research and teaching require careful coordination of equipment, resources, and facilities. The UI design specifies a resource management system that allows professors to manage equipment inventory, make reservations, track usage, and coordinate with other faculty members.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Equipment Inventory Management
- [ ] **Equipment Catalog**: Browse and search comprehensive equipment database
- [ ] **Equipment Details**: View specifications, availability, location, and usage instructions
- [ ] **Equipment Status**: Real-time status tracking (available, in-use, maintenance, reserved)
- [ ] **Equipment History**: Track usage history and maintenance records

### Reservation System
- [ ] **Equipment Booking**: Reserve equipment for specific time slots and projects
- [ ] **Calendar Integration**: Visual calendar showing equipment availability and reservations
- [ ] **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection and resolution of scheduling conflicts
- [ ] **Reservation Notifications**: Automated reminders for upcoming reservations

### Resource Allocation
- [ ] **Project Resource Planning**: Allocate equipment needs for specific research projects
- [ ] **Student Access Management**: Grant/revoke student access to specific equipment
- [ ] **Usage Quotas**: Set and monitor equipment usage limits per project or student
- [ ] **Priority Booking**: Priority system for critical research needs

### Equipment Maintenance
- [ ] **Maintenance Scheduling**: Schedule regular maintenance and calibration
- [ ] **Issue Reporting**: Report equipment problems and track repair status
- [ ] **Service History**: Maintain comprehensive service and repair logs
- [ ] **Replacement Planning**: Track equipment lifecycle and plan replacements

### Laboratory Space Management
- [ ] **Lab Space Reservation**: Book laboratory spaces for experiments and classes
- [ ] **Space Configuration**: Manage lab setup requirements and configurations
- [ ] **Safety Compliance**: Track safety certifications and requirements
- [ ] **Access Control**: Manage lab access permissions and security

### Resource Sharing and Collaboration
- [ ] **Inter-lab Sharing**: Coordinate equipment sharing between laboratories
- [ ] **External Partnerships**: Manage shared resources with external institutions
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**: Track and analyze equipment utilization patterns
- [ ] **Cost Tracking**: Monitor equipment usage costs and budget allocation

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Implement equipment catalog with advanced search and filtering
- Create interactive calendar for equipment reservations
- Design equipment status dashboard with real-time updates
- Build mobile-responsive interface for on-the-go equipment management

### Backend
- Develop equipment reservation and conflict resolution system
- Implement real-time equipment status tracking
- Create maintenance scheduling and notification system
- Design analytics engine for usage patterns and optimization

### Database
- Create comprehensive equipment and facility database schema
- Implement reservation and scheduling tables with conflict checking
- Design maintenance and service history tracking system

### Integration
- Integrate with institutional equipment databases
- Connect with calendar systems for scheduling
- Interface with access control systems for lab security

## Route Structure
```

## Dependencies
- Story 008: Professor Topic Management (for project context)
- Story 049: Shared Document Management System (for equipment manuals)
- Story 005: Shared Calendar System (for reservation scheduling)
- Story 010: Professor Process Management (for project workflow integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Equipment catalog is fully searchable with detailed filtering options
- [ ] Reservation system prevents double-booking and handles conflicts gracefully
- [ ] Real-time equipment status updates work reliably
- [ ] Maintenance tracking system is integrated with reservation availability
- [ ] Analytics provide meaningful insights into equipment utilization
- [ ] Mobile interface allows equipment management from any location
- [ ] Integration testing completed with calendar and notification systems
- [ ] Performance testing validates system handles 1000+ equipment items

## Notes
- UI design includes "资源上传界面" (resource upload interface) for equipment documentation
- System should support "资源配置" (resource configuration) for project-specific needs
- Consider implementing QR code scanning for quick equipment check-in/check-out
- Include equipment usage cost tracking for budget management and billing
- Ensure system supports both individual and shared equipment models
