# Story 120: Secretary Intelligent Coordination System

## Description
As a **Secretary**, I want an intelligent coordination system that helps me manage complex scheduling, resource allocation, and multi-stakeholder communication so that I can efficiently coordinate all aspects of the research program with minimal conflicts and optimal resource utilization.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Smart Scheduling and Coordination
- [ ] I can use an intelligent scheduling system that automatically detects conflicts
- [ ] I can coordinate multiple stakeholders' schedules with one interface
- [ ] I can set up recurring events and meetings with smart conflict resolution
- [ ] I can receive automated suggestions for optimal meeting times

### Resource Management and Allocation
- [ ] I can manage venue bookings with real-time availability checking
- [ ] I can coordinate equipment and facility reservations
- [ ] I can track resource utilization and generate optimization recommendations
- [ ] I can handle last-minute changes with automatic re-scheduling suggestions

### Multi-Channel Communication Hub
- [ ] I can send announcements through multiple channels simultaneously
- [ ] I can track message delivery and read receipts across all stakeholders
- [ ] I can manage urgent communications with escalation workflows
- [ ] I can maintain communication templates for common scenarios

### Issue Resolution and Problem Management
- [ ] I can use a ticket system to track and resolve issues
- [ ] I can escalate problems based on priority and impact
- [ ] I can maintain a knowledge base of solutions for common problems
- [ ] I can generate reports on issue patterns and resolution efficiency

### Intelligent Workflow Automation
- [ ] I can set up automated workflows for routine coordination tasks
- [ ] I can receive AI-powered suggestions for process improvements
- [ ] I can automate reminder sequences based on stakeholder behavior
- [ ] I can use predictive analytics to anticipate coordination challenges

## User Stories

### Conflict-Free Scheduling
```
As a Secretary
I want the system to automatically detect scheduling conflicts
So that I can avoid double-bookings and optimize everyone's time
```

### Resource Optimization
```
As a Secretary
I want to see resource utilization analytics
So that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation and planning
```

### Proactive Issue Management
```
As a Secretary
I want to receive early warnings about potential coordination problems
So that I can take preventive action before issues become critical
```

## Technical Requirements

### Scheduling Intelligence
- AI-powered conflict detection and resolution
- Multi-calendar integration and synchronization
- Intelligent time zone handling
- Automated scheduling optimization algorithms

### Communication Management
- Multi-channel notification system
- Template management with dynamic content
- Delivery tracking and analytics
- Escalation workflow engine

### Performance Considerations
- Real-time updates for scheduling changes
- Fast conflict detection for large groups
- Efficient resource allocation algorithms
- Responsive mobile interface for on-the-go coordination

## Dependencies
- User Authentication (Story 001)
- Secretary Dashboard (Story 002)
- Notification System (Story 004)
- Shared Calendar System (Story 005)
- Secretary Process Monitoring (Story 018)

## Acceptance Tests

### Smart Scheduling Test
```
Given I am coordinating a meeting with multiple professors
When I select potential time slots
Then the system should highlight conflicts and suggest alternatives
And automatically send invitations once a time is confirmed
```

### Resource Conflict Detection Test
```
Given I am booking a laboratory for a course
When I select dates that conflict with existing reservations
Then the system should warn me and suggest alternative dates
And show resource utilization patterns
```

### Communication Tracking Test
```
Given I send an important announcement to all stakeholders
When I check the delivery status
Then I should see read receipts, response rates, and follow-up suggestions
And be able to send targeted reminders to non-responders
```
