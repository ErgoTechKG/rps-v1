# Story 140: Shared Version Control System

As a **User of any role**, I want a comprehensive version control system for documents and course materials so that I can collaborate effectively, track changes, and maintain historical records of important academic documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] I can require approval workflows for changes to critical documents
- [ ] I can see pending changes that need review before publication
- [ ] I can compare different versions to understand what changed

### Branch and Merge Capabilities
- [ ] I can create document branches for experimental changes
- [ ] I can merge approved changes back to the main document version
- [ ] I can maintain separate versions for different academic terms
