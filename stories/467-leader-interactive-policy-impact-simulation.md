# Story 467: Leader Interactive Policy Impact Simulation

## Description
As a Leader, I need an interactive policy impact simulation tool that allows me to model potential policy changes and visualize their effects in real-time before implementation, enabling data-driven decision making with predicted outcomes and risk assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Real-time Policy Simulation Interface**
   - Interactive scenario modeling with adjustable parameters
   - Live simulation execution with immediate visual feedback
   - Problem prediction with risk indicators
   - Impact range assessment with affected areas highlighted

2. **Visual Impact Representation**
   - Animated charts showing projected changes over time
   - Color-coded impact zones (positive, neutral, negative)
   - Interactive timeline showing short-term vs long-term effects
   - Dependency relationship visualization

3. **Scenario Management**
   - Save and load simulation scenarios
   - Compare multiple scenarios side-by-side
   - Export simulation results and reports
   - Version control for policy iterations

4. **Data-Driven Predictions**
   - Historical data integration for accuracy
   - Machine learning-based outcome predictions
   - Confidence intervals for predictions
   - What-if analysis capabilities

5. **Stakeholder Impact Analysis**
   - Breakdown by affected user groups (professors, students, etc.)
   - Resource impact calculations
   - Budget implication projections
   - Performance metric predictions

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React with D3.js for advanced visualizations
- Real-time simulation engine
- State management for complex scenario data
- WebSocket for live updates during simulations
- Export functionality for PDF/Excel reports

## Dependencies
- Story 042: Leader AI Report Generation
- Story 045: Leader Curriculum Design
- Story 046: Leader Governance Controls
- Story 080: Leader Predictive Analytics System
- Story 139: Leader Impact Assessment System
