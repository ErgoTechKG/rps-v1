# Story 210: Secretary Automated Workflow Orchestration System

## Title
Secretary Automated Workflow Orchestration for Complex Multi-Step Process Management

## Story
As a secretary, I want an automated workflow orchestration system so that I can design, deploy, and monitor complex multi-step processes that automatically coordinate tasks between different roles, trigger actions based on conditions, and ensure institutional procedures are followed consistently.

## Background
Secretaries need sophisticated workflow automation capabilities to manage complex institutional processes that involve multiple stakeholders, conditional logic, and time-sensitive coordination across different departments and systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Workflow Design and Configuration
- [ ] Visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop interface for process design
- [ ] Conditional logic support with if-then-else branching and decision points
- [ ] Multi-role task assignment with automatic routing and escalation
- [ ] Template library for common institutional processes and workflows
- [ ] Version control and testing capabilities for workflow modifications

### Process Automation Engine
- [ ] Event-driven triggers for automatic workflow initiation
- [ ] Integration with external systems for data exchange and task creation
- [ ] Scheduled workflows with complex timing and recurrence patterns
- [ ] Parallel processing support for concurrent task execution
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms for failed workflow steps

### Monitoring and Control Dashboard
- [ ] Real-time workflow status monitoring with visual progress indicators
- [ ] Performance analytics for workflow efficiency and bottleneck identification
- [ ] Exception handling dashboard for manual intervention requirements
- [ ] Audit trail tracking for compliance and process improvement
- [ ] Alert and notification system for critical workflow events

### Advanced Orchestration Features
- [ ] Dynamic task assignment based on workload and availability
- [ ] Approval chain management with delegation and substitute assignment
- [ ] Document lifecycle management with automated routing and archival
- [ ] Integration with AI systems for intelligent decision support
- [ ] Cross-institutional workflow coordination for collaborative processes

## Technical Requirements

### Workflow Engine Architecture
- Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 compliance
- Microservices architecture for scalable workflow execution
- Message queue integration for reliable task distribution
- Database transaction management for workflow state consistency
- API framework for external system integration

### Integration and Connectivity
- RESTful API design for third-party system integration
- Webhook support for real-time event handling
- Email and notification service integration
- Calendar and scheduling system connectivity
- Document management system integration

### Security and Compliance
- Role-based access control for workflow design and execution
- Data encryption for sensitive workflow information
- Audit logging for compliance and security monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery for workflow continuity
- Privacy controls for personal and confidential data

## UI/UX Requirements

### Workflow Design Interface
- Intuitive visual workflow designer with professional appearance
- Comprehensive component library for different workflow elements
- Real-time validation and error highlighting during design
- Collaborative editing features for team-based workflow development
- Import/export capabilities for workflow sharing and backup

### Process Monitoring Dashboard
- Executive-level dashboard for workflow performance overview
- Detailed process tracking with drill-down capabilities
- Exception and error reporting with resolution recommendations
- Performance metrics visualization with trend analysis
- Mobile-responsive interface for remote monitoring

### Task Management Integration
- Seamless integration with existing task management interfaces
- Automatic task creation and assignment from workflow triggers
- Progress tracking and status updates fed back to workflow engine
- Priority and deadline management with escalation protocols
- User notification preferences and communication channels

## Dependencies
- Story 016: Secretary Course Setup and Configuration (process foundation)
- Story 018: Secretary Process Monitoring (monitoring infrastructure)
- Story 043: Secretary User Management (user role integration)
- Story 082: Secretary Advanced Workflow Automation (basic automation)

## Risks and Considerations
- Complexity of workflow design may require extensive user training
- Integration challenges with legacy institutional systems
- Performance implications of complex workflows with many participants
- Change management issues when automating existing manual processes
- Data consistency and integrity across distributed workflow steps

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Automated workflow orchestration system fully operational
- [ ] Visual workflow designer tested with complex institutional processes
- [ ] Integration with all major institutional systems completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for high-volume workflow execution
- [ ] Security audit passed for sensitive process automation
- [ ] User training program developed and delivered
- [ ] Documentation created for workflow design and administration
- [ ] Disaster recovery and backup procedures tested and validated
