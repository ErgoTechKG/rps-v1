# Story 174: Leader Predictive Resource Optimization Platform

**As a** 领导 (Leader)  
**I want** a predictive resource optimization platform with advanced analytics and scenario modeling  
**So that** I can make data-driven decisions about resource allocation, predict future needs, and optimize institutional efficiency

## Acceptance Criteria

### Resource Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] I can view comprehensive resource utilization across all departments
- [ ] I can see real-time metrics for laboratory usage, equipment efficiency, and staff workload
- [ ] I can analyze resource trends over time with interactive visualizations
- [ ] I can compare resource efficiency between different programs and courses
- [ ] I can identify underutilized or overallocated resources automatically

### Predictive Modeling System
- [ ] I can forecast future resource needs based on historical data and enrollment trends
- [ ] I can model different allocation scenarios and their predicted outcomes
- [ ] I can receive AI-powered recommendations for resource optimization
- [ ] I can simulate the impact of new program launches on resource requirements
- [ ] I can predict budget implications of different resource allocation strategies

### Strategic Resource Planning
- [ ] I can create long-term resource allocation plans with milestone tracking
- [ ] I can set resource efficiency targets and monitor progress
- [ ] I can balance resource distribution across competing priorities
- [ ] I can evaluate ROI for different resource investment options
- [ ] I can plan for seasonal variations in resource demand

### Cost-Benefit Analysis Tools
- [ ] I can perform comprehensive cost-benefit analysis for resource decisions
- [ ] I can calculate total cost of ownership for equipment and facilities
- [ ] I can evaluate the financial impact of resource sharing initiatives
- [ ] I can assess the cost-effectiveness of outsourcing vs. internal resources
- [ ] I can generate detailed financial projections for resource investments

### Resource Optimization Recommendations
- [ ] I can receive intelligent suggestions for improving resource efficiency
- [ ] I can see automated alerts for resource bottlenecks and waste
- [ ] I can access best practice recommendations from peer institutions
- [ ] I can evaluate the potential impact of optimization strategies
- [ ] I can track the success of implemented optimization measures
