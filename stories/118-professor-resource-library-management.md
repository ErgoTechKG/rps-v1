- [ ] I can organize resources into categories: teaching materials, references, QA resources
- [ ] I can create folders and subfolders for better organization
- [ ] I can add tags and descriptions to resources for easier search

### File Management Features
- [ ] I can use drag-and-drop upload interface for multiple files
- [ ] I can preview files online without downloading

- [ ] I can control access permissions (public, course-specific, student-specific)

### Resource Sharing and Distribution
- [ ] I can share entire folders or individual files with students
- [ ] I can create curated resource collections for specific topics
- [ ] I can track download statistics and student access
- [ ] I can notify students when new resources are added

### Version Control and History
- [ ] I can upload new versions of existing resources
- [ ] I can maintain version history for all files
- [ ] I can revert to previous versions if needed
- [ ] I can see which students accessed which versions

### Integration with Course Activities

## User Stories

### Resource Management
```
As a Professor
I want to create organized folders for my course materials
So that students can easily find relevant resources for each topic
```

### Access Control
```
As a Professor  
I want to control who can access specific resources
So that I can share sensitive materials only with appropriate students
```

### Usage Analytics
```
As a Professor
I want to see which resources are most accessed by students
So that I can understand what materials are most valuable and useful
```

## Technical Requirements

### Storage and Organization
- File upload with progress tracking
- Hierarchical folder structure
- File type validation and size limits
- Automatic file compression for large files

### Preview and Sharing
- Built-in file preview for common formats
- Share link generation with expiration dates
- Download tracking and analytics
- Integration with notification system

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for large file lists
- Thumbnail generation for images and videos
- CDN integration for fast file delivery
- Bandwidth optimization for video content

## Dependencies
- User Authentication (Story 001)
- Professor Dashboard (Story 002) 
- Notification System (Story 004)
- Document Management System (Story 049)
- Professor Topic Management (Story 008)

## Acceptance Tests

### File Upload Test
```
Given I am a logged-in Professor
When I drag and drop multiple files to the upload area
Then the files should be uploaded with progress indicators
And I should be able to organize them into folders
```

### Resource Sharing Test
```
Given I have uploaded course materials
When I generate a share link for a resource
Then students with the link should be able to access the file
And I should see download statistics in my dashboard
```

### Permission Control Test
```
Given I have created different resource categories
When I set access permissions for each category
Then only authorized students should be able to access restricted resources
```

## Notes
- This story focuses specifically on the resource management capabilities described in professor-ui.md lines 306-315
- Integrates with existing document management but provides professor-specific resource organization features
- Supports the QA and materials management workflows described in the UI designs
