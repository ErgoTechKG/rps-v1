## Title
Secretary Blockchain-Based Audit Trail System

## Role
Secretary

## Description
As a secretary, I need a blockchain-based audit trail system that creates immutable records of all institutional activities, provides transparent governance tracking, ensures data integrity, and supports regulatory compliance through cryptographically verified documentation.

## Background
The UI design specifications (secretary-ui.md lines 990-1125) describe an advanced blockchain infrastructure for maintaining immutable audit trails, ensuring data integrity, and providing transparent tracking of institutional processes and decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement permissioned blockchain network for institutional data
- [ ] Create immutable records for all critical institutional activities
- [ ] Support smart contracts for automated compliance and governance
- [ ] Provide cryptographic verification of document authenticity

### Comprehensive Activity Tracking
- [ ] Record all user actions with timestamp and digital signatures
- [ ] Track document creation, modification, and access history
- [ ] Monitor system configuration changes and administrative actions
- [ ] Log all financial transactions and resource allocations

### Governance and Compliance
- [ ] Track policy changes and approval workflows on blockchain
- [ ] Maintain regulatory compliance records with verifiable timestamps
- [ ] Support audit trails for accreditation and external reviews
- [ ] Provide tamper-evident documentation for legal proceedings

### Data Integrity and Verification
- [ ] Ensure data immutability through cryptographic hashing
- [ ] Provide real-time verification of document authenticity
- [ ] Detect and alert on any attempt to modify historical records
- [ ] Support cross-institutional verification of credentials and documents

### Query and Reporting Interface
- [ ] Provide intuitive interface for querying blockchain records
- [ ] Generate comprehensive audit reports from blockchain data
- [ ] Support complex queries across multiple transaction types
- [ ] Export verified records for external auditing and compliance

## Technical Notes

### Architecture
- Private/consortium blockchain network (Hyperledger Fabric or similar)
- Smart contract development platform
- Cryptographic key management system
- Integration layer for existing institutional systems

### Integration Requirements
- All existing institutional system APIs
- Document management system integration
- User authentication and authorization systems
- External regulatory and compliance platforms

### Performance Requirements
- Transaction processing within 10 seconds for standard operations
- Support for high-volume transaction logging (10,000+ daily transactions)
- 99.99% uptime for critical audit trail functionality
- Efficient query performance for large historical datasets

### Security Requirements
- Multi-signature authorization for critical operations
- Role-based access control with blockchain verification
- Secure key management and rotation
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Dependencies
- Story 043: Secretary User Management
- Story 044: Secretary System Backup
- Story 138: Secretary Audit Trail System
- Story 193: Shared Advanced Security and Privacy Management
