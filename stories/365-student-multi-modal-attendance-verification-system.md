# Story 365: Student Multi-Modal Attendance Verification System

## Title
Advanced Attendance System with Multiple Verification Methods

## Description
As a Student, I need a multi-modal attendance verification system with GPS location, QR code scanning, face recognition, and intelligent conflict detection to ensure accurate attendance tracking while providing flexible options for different classroom situations.

## Actors
- Student (Primary)
- Professor
- System Administrator
- Location Services

## Preconditions
- Student enrolled in courses
- Attendance requirements defined
- Verification methods configured
- Privacy consent obtained

## Postconditions
- Attendance recorded accurately
- Verification completed
- Conflicts resolved
- Records maintained

## Normal Flow
1. Student receives attendance notification
2. System detects context:
   - Physical location
   - Class schedule
   - Network connection
   - Available sensors
3. Multiple verification options presented:
   - GPS check-in
   - QR code scan
   - Face recognition
   - Bluetooth beacon
   - Manual code entry
4. Student selects preferred method:
   - GPS: Auto-verifies location
   - QR: Camera scan required
   - Face: Biometric check
   - Beacon: Proximity detection
   - Code: Professor provides
5. Verification process:
   - Method-specific UI loads
   - Real-time feedback provided
   - Success confirmation shown
   - Backup options available
6. Intelligent validation:
   - Cross-reference schedule
   - Detect anomalies
   - Prevent fraud
   - Handle edge cases
7. Conflict detection:
   - Multiple class conflicts
   - Location mismatches
   - Time discrepancies
   - Technical issues
8. Smart resolution:
   - Auto-resolve simple conflicts
   - Escalate complex issues
   - Provide explanations
   - Suggest solutions
9. Attendance confirmed
10. Records synchronized

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: Offline Mode
1. At step 2, no network detected
2. Offline mode activated
3. Local verification performed
4. Data cached securely
5. Sync when connected
6. Timestamp preserved
7. Flow continues from step 9

### Alternative Flow 2: Remote Attendance
1. At step 3, remote class detected
2. Different options shown:
   - Video verification
   - Live polling
   - Activity tracking
   - Engagement metrics
3. Continuous monitoring
4. Participation tracked
5. Flow adapts to online format

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: Verification Failure
1. At any verification step, method fails
2. System suggests alternatives
3. Manual override available
4. Professor notified
5. Grace period provided
6. Issue documented

### Exception 2: Privacy Concern
1. At step 4, student declines biometrics
2. Alternative methods emphasized
3. Privacy settings reviewed
4. Non-invasive options provided
5. Attendance still possible
6. Preferences saved

## Business Rules
- At least 2 verification methods required
- Location accuracy within 50 meters
- Face recognition optional
- Privacy settings respected
- Attendance window Â±15 minutes

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Verification < 5 seconds
- 99% accuracy rate
- Works offline
- Battery efficient
- GDPR compliant

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All verification methods functional
- [ ] GPS accuracy meets requirements
- [ ] QR codes scan reliably
- [ ] Face recognition optional
- [ ] Conflict detection works
- [ ] Offline mode syncs properly
- [ ] Privacy controls respected

## Technical Notes
- Geofencing for GPS verification
- Dynamic QR generation
- On-device face recognition
- Bluetooth Low Energy beacons
- Edge computing for privacy

## UI/UX Considerations
- One-tap verification preferred
- Clear method icons
- Progress indicators
- Success animations
- Error recovery guidance
- Accessibility options

## Dependencies
- Stories: 040, 005, 004, 001
- Location services
- Camera permissions
- Biometric APIs
- Beacon infrastructure

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Location spoofing
  - **Mitigation**: Multi-factor verification
- **Risk**: Privacy violations
  - **Mitigation**: On-device processing
- **Risk**: Technical failures
  - **Mitigation**: Multiple backup methods

## Assumptions
- Students have smartphones
- Classrooms have infrastructure
- Privacy laws permit tracking
- Multiple methods improve accuracy
