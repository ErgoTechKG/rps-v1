# Story 356: Leader AI-Powered Report Editor

## Title
AI-Powered Report Editor with Real-Time Collaboration

## Description
As a Leader, I need a comprehensive report editing interface with AI optimization, real-time collaboration features, and intelligent content suggestions to create professional reports efficiently while leveraging data insights and team contributions.

## Actors
- Leader (Primary)
- AI Assistant
- Collaborating Leaders
- Report Recipients

## Preconditions
- Leader is authenticated and has report creation permissions
- AI service is available and trained on institutional data
- Report templates and data sources are configured
- Collaboration infrastructure is operational

## Postconditions
- Reports are generated with AI assistance
- Version history is maintained
- Collaborative edits are synchronized
- Reports can be exported in multiple formats

## Normal Flow
1. Leader accesses the AI Report Editor
2. System displays report templates and recent drafts
3. Leader selects template or starts new report
4. AI suggests initial structure based on report type
5. Leader uses editing tools:
   - AI-powered writing assistance
   - Data insertion panels
   - Chart and visualization tools
   - Smart formatting options
6. System provides real-time suggestions:
   - Content improvements
   - Data insights
   - Grammar and style corrections
   - Relevant statistics
7. Leader invites collaborators for review
8. Collaborators make edits with tracking
9. AI optimizes final content
10. Leader publishes or exports report

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow 1: AI Data Analysis
1. At step 5, Leader requests data analysis
2. AI analyzes available datasets
3. System suggests relevant visualizations
4. Leader selects and customizes charts
5. AI generates insights and interpretations
6. Flow continues from step 7

### Alternative Flow 2: Template Customization
1. At step 3, Leader chooses to customize template
2. System provides template editor
3. Leader modifies sections and structure
4. AI suggests improvements to template
5. Template is saved for future use
6. Flow continues from step 4

## Exceptional Flows

### Exception 1: AI Service Unavailable
1. At any step involving AI, service is down
2. System notifies Leader of limited functionality
3. Basic editing tools remain available
4. Manual report creation continues
5. AI features resume when service restored

### Exception 2: Collaboration Conflict
1. At step 8, simultaneous edits conflict
2. System highlights conflicting changes
3. Real-time merge interface appears
4. Leaders resolve conflicts manually
5. System saves resolved version
6. Flow continues from step 9

## Business Rules
- AI suggestions must be reviewable before application
- All data used must comply with privacy policies
- Version control maintains last 30 versions
- Export formats include PDF, Word, HTML, and PowerPoint
- Collaborative editing shows real-time presence

## Non-Functional Requirements
- AI response time < 2 seconds
- Support 10 simultaneous collaborators
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Mobile-responsive editor interface
- Accessibility compliance for all tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AI writing assistance provides relevant suggestions
- [ ] Data insertion integrates with institutional databases
- [ ] Real-time collaboration shows live updates
- [ ] Version history allows rollback
- [ ] Export maintains formatting across formats
- [ ] Smart suggestions improve report quality
- [ ] Performance meets response time requirements

## Technical Notes
- Integrate with GPT-4 or similar for AI assistance
- Use WebSockets for real-time collaboration
- Implement operational transformation for conflict resolution
- Cache frequently used data for performance
- Use vector embeddings for semantic search

## UI/UX Considerations
- Split-panel interface with editor and data panels
- Floating AI assistant with minimize option
- Visual indicators for collaborative presence
- Inline suggestion previews
- Distraction-free writing mode option

## Dependencies
- Stories: 042, 019, 047, 127
- AI language model service
- Real-time collaboration infrastructure
- Data warehouse integration
- Document export service

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: AI generates inappropriate content
  - **Mitigation**: Content filtering and human review
- **Risk**: Data security in collaborative editing
  - **Mitigation**: Role-based access controls
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with large reports
  - **Mitigation**: Pagination and lazy loading

## Assumptions
- Institution has AI usage policies in place
- Leaders are trained on AI-assisted writing
- Network infrastructure supports real-time features
- Data sources are properly integrated
