# Story 368: Secretary Visual Workflow Orchestration Designer

## Description
As a secretary, I want a visual drag-and-drop workflow designer that allows me to create, modify, and monitor automated processes for course management, data collection, and student coordination without requiring technical programming skills.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Workflow Designer Interface
- [ ] **Drag-and-Drop Canvas**
  - Large canvas area for workflow design
  - Palette of pre-built workflow components
  - Drag components from palette to canvas
  - Visual connectors between workflow steps
  - Auto-alignment and grid snapping

- [ ] **Workflow Components Library**
  - Data collection triggers (form submissions, deadlines)
  - Notification actions (email, system alerts, SMS)
  - Approval processes (single/multi-level approval)
  - Data processing steps (validation, formatting)
  - Integration connectors (external systems)
  - Conditional logic branches (if/then/else)
  - Timer and scheduling components

- [ ] **Component Configuration**
  - Properties panel for selected components
  - Form-based configuration interface
  - Template selection for common patterns
  - Variable mapping between components
  - Preview mode for component testing

### Workflow Management Features
- [ ] **Workflow Templates**
  - Pre-built templates for common scenarios
  - Course setup workflow template
  - Student application processing template
  - Grade collection and notification template
  - Crisis management response template
  - Custom template creation and sharing

- [ ] **Version Control System**
  - Workflow versioning with change tracking
  - Rollback to previous versions
  - Compare different workflow versions
  - Deployment staging (test/production)
  - Change approval process for critical workflows

- [ ] **Testing and Simulation**
  - Workflow simulation with sample data
  - Step-by-step execution preview
  - Error condition testing
  - Performance impact analysis
  - Validation before deployment

### Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] **Real-Time Workflow Monitoring**
  - Live dashboard showing active workflows
  - Execution status for each workflow instance
  - Error alerts and notifications
  - Performance metrics and timing
  - Bottleneck identification

- [ ] **Workflow Analytics**
  - Execution frequency and success rates
  - Average processing times per step
  - User interaction patterns
  - System resource utilization
  - ROI and efficiency improvements

### Integration Capabilities
- [ ] **System Integrations**
  - Email system integration
  - Calendar system synchronization
  - Document management system
  - External database connections
  - Third-party service APIs

- [ ] **Data Flow Management**
  - Input/output mapping between systems
  - Data transformation rules
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Data validation and cleansing
  - Audit trail for data changes

## Technical Requirements
- Modern workflow engine (e.g., BPMN-compatible)
- Drag-and-drop UI framework
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- API integration framework
- Version control system for workflows

## Dependencies
- Story 016: Secretary Course Setup and Configuration
- Story 018: Secretary Process Monitoring
- Story 043: Secretary User Management
- Story 082: Secretary Advanced Workflow Automation
