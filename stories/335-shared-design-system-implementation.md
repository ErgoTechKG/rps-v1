# Story 335: Shared Design System Implementation and Management

## Title
Shared Design System Implementation with Component Library Management

## Role
Shared

## Category
UI/UX Foundation

## Priority
High

## Description
Implement a comprehensive design system that provides consistent visual language, component libraries, accessibility standards, and theme management across the entire research management platform. The system ensures visual consistency, development efficiency, and scalable user experience design.

## User Story
As a developer and designer, I want a comprehensive design system with standardized components and guidelines so that I can build consistent, accessible, and maintainable user interfaces across all platform features.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Design System Foundation
- [ ] Complete color palette implementation:
  - Primary brand colors (Brand Blue #1A73E8, Academic Purple #7C4DFF)
  - Functional colors (Success #4CAF50, Warning #FF9800, Error #F44336, Info #2196F3)
  - Role-specific colors (Professor Blue, Student Green, Secretary Purple, Leader Gold)
  - Neutral colors with accessibility-compliant contrast ratios
- [ ] Typography system with Chinese and English font support:
  - Font families (Source Han Sans for Chinese, Roboto for English)
  - Heading hierarchy (H1-H5) with proper line heights
  - Body text scales (large 16px, standard 14px, small 12px)
  - Font weight specifications (400, 500, 600)

### Component Library
- [ ] Basic component implementations:
  - Buttons (primary, secondary, text, danger) with all states
  - Form inputs (text, textarea, select, radio, checkbox) with validation
  - Cards with consistent styling and hover effects
  - Navigation components (top nav, sidebar nav) with responsive behavior
  - Modal dialogs with proper accessibility attributes
- [ ] Data display components:
  - Tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
  - Charts and graphs with consistent styling
  - Status indicators and badges
  - Progress bars and loading states

### Spacing and Layout System
- [ ] 8px base grid system implementation
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints (MD: 768px, LG: 992px, XL: 1200px)
- [ ] Container and layout utilities
- [ ] Flexbox and grid layout components
- [ ] Consistent margin and padding scales

### Accessibility Implementation
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
- [ ] Color contrast ratio validation (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support with proper focus indicators
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility with ARIA attributes
- [ ] Alternative text for all images and icons
- [ ] Font scaling support up to 200%

### Theme Management System
- [ ] CSS custom properties (variables) for all design tokens
- [ ] Theme switching capability (light/dark modes)
- [ ] Role-based theme variations with appropriate color schemes
- [ ] Dynamic theme application without page reload
- [ ] User preference persistence

### Documentation and Tools
- [ ] Interactive component documentation with code examples
- [ ] Design token documentation with usage guidelines
- [ ] Accessibility guidelines and testing checklists
- [ ] Implementation examples for common patterns
- [ ] Figma/Sketch design file synchronization

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Implementation
- CSS-in-JS or CSS custom properties for theming
- Component library built with React/Vue framework
- Storybook or similar tool for component documentation
- Responsive design utilities and mixins

### Build System
- Design token compilation from source files
- Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Visual regression testing for component consistency
- Bundle optimization for production deployment

### Documentation Platform
- Interactive component playground
- Design system website with search functionality
- Version control for design system updates
- Integration with development workflow

### Quality Assurance
- Automated accessibility testing with axe-core
- Visual regression testing with Percy or similar
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance monitoring for component rendering

## Dependencies
- 001 (User Authentication)
- 003 (Shared Navigation System)
- 079 (Shared Design System Management)
- 088 (Shared Accessibility Compliance System)

## Estimated Effort
Extra Large (15-25 story points)

## Notes
This story implements the comprehensive design system defined in shared-ui.md, providing the foundational visual language and component library that ensures consistency across all platform features. The implementation follows the professional, academic design principles with proper accessibility support and scalable architecture for future expansion.
