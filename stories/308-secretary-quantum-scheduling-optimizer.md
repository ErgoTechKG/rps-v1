- [ ] Complex rule engine for institutional scheduling policies
- [ ] Dynamic constraint priority weighting and adjustment
- [ ] Soft and hard constraint differentiation and handling
- [ ] Multi-stakeholder preference integration and balancing

### Predictive Scheduling Intelligence
- [ ] Machine learning prediction of future scheduling needs
- [ ] Seasonal and cyclical pattern recognition and accommodation
- [ ] Demand forecasting for resources and facilities
- [ ] Proactive scheduling for anticipated conflicts and issues

### Multi-Resource Optimization
- [ ] Simultaneous optimization of rooms, equipment, personnel, and time
- [ ] Cross-departmental resource sharing and coordination
- [ ] Virtual and physical resource integration and management
