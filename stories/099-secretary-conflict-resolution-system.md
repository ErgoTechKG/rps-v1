# User Story 099: Secretary Conflict Resolution System

## Story Overview

**As a** Secretary  
**I want** an intelligent conflict resolution system  
**So that** I can efficiently identify, analyze, and resolve scheduling conflicts, resource allocation issues, and other operational problems that arise in course management.

## Background

Academic operations involve complex interactions between schedules, resources, personnel, and facilities. The UI design specifies a comprehensive conflict resolution system that helps secretaries proactively identify conflicts and provides tools and workflows to resolve them efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Conflict Detection and Identification
- [ ] **Automated Conflict Detection**: Continuously monitor for scheduling, resource, and capacity conflicts
- [ ] **Conflict Categorization**: Classify conflicts by type (scheduling, resource, personnel, facility)
- [ ] **Severity Assessment**: Automatically assess conflict severity and impact
- [ ] **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notifications when conflicts are detected

### Scheduling Conflict Management
- [ ] **Time Slot Conflicts**: Detect and resolve overlapping class schedules and meetings
- [ ] **Professor Availability**: Monitor professor scheduling conflicts across courses
- [ ] **Student Schedule Conflicts**: Identify student enrollment conflicts and time clashes
- [ ] **Facility Double-booking**: Prevent and resolve classroom and lab scheduling conflicts

### Resource Conflict Resolution
- [ ] **Equipment Conflicts**: Manage competing requests for laboratory equipment
- [ ] **Space Allocation**: Resolve conflicts in classroom and facility assignments
- [ ] **Personnel Conflicts**: Address conflicts in teaching assistant and staff assignments
- [ ] **Budget Conflicts**: Identify and resolve resource allocation budget conflicts

### Conflict Resolution Workflows
- [ ] **Resolution Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions for conflict resolution
- [ ] **Escalation Procedures**: Defined escalation paths for complex conflicts
- [ ] **Stakeholder Notification**: Automatic notification of affected parties
- [ ] **Resolution Tracking**: Monitor resolution progress and outcomes

### Communication and Coordination
- [ ] **Conflict Dashboard**: Central view of all active conflicts and their status
- [ ] **Stakeholder Communication**: Direct communication tools with affected parties
- [ ] **Resolution Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of resolution decisions
- [ ] **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback on resolution effectiveness

### Preventive Measures
- [ ] **Conflict Prevention Rules**: Configurable rules to prevent common conflicts
- [ ] **Capacity Planning**: Proactive planning to avoid resource overallocation
- [ ] **Schedule Optimization**: Suggestions for optimal scheduling to minimize conflicts
- [ ] **Historical Analysis**: Learn from past conflicts to improve prevention

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Implement conflict visualization dashboard with interactive elements
- Create conflict resolution workflow interface with drag-drop capabilities
- Design communication tools for stakeholder coordination
- Build analytics interface for conflict pattern analysis

### Backend
- Develop conflict detection algorithms for various resource types
- Implement workflow engine for resolution processes
- Create notification and communication system
- Design analytics engine for conflict pattern recognition

### Database
- Create comprehensive conflict tracking and resolution schema
- Implement historical conflict data for pattern analysis
- Design stakeholder communication and feedback storage

### Integration
- Integrate with scheduling systems for real-time conflict detection
- Connect with resource management systems
- Interface with notification systems for stakeholder alerts

## Route Structure
```
/secretary/conflict-resolution/
├── /dashboard        # Central conflict monitoring and management
├── /active-conflicts # Current conflicts requiring resolution
├── /resolution-tools # Tools and workflows for conflict resolution
├── /communication    # Stakeholder communication and coordination
├── /prevention       # Conflict prevention rules and planning

## Dependencies
- Story 018: Secretary Process Monitoring (for process context)
- Story 055: Secretary Monitoring Control Center (for monitoring integration)
- Story 005: Shared Calendar System (for scheduling integration)
- Story 004: Notification System (for stakeholder alerts)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Conflict detection system accurately identifies various types of conflicts
- [ ] Resolution workflows guide users through efficient problem-solving processes
- [ ] Communication tools enable effective coordination with all stakeholders
- [ ] Analytics provide insights into conflict patterns and prevention opportunities
- [ ] System handles complex multi-party conflicts with multiple resolution options
- [ ] Real-time performance maintains responsiveness during peak conflict periods
- [ ] Integration testing completed with all relevant scheduling and resource systems
- [ ] User training materials created for conflict resolution procedures

## Notes
- UI design references "冲突检测" (conflict detection) and "应对预案" (response plans)
- System should support "场地冲突需协调" (venue conflict coordination) as mentioned in monitoring dashboard
- Consider implementing machine learning for conflict prediction and prevention
- Include workflow for emergency conflict resolution outside business hours
- Ensure system maintains audit trail of all conflict resolution decisions
