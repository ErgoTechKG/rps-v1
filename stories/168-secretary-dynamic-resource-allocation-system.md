## Story
**As a** Secretary  
**I want** a dynamic resource allocation system that optimizes the use of facilities, equipment, and human resources  
**So that** I can maximize resource utilization, prevent conflicts, and ensure efficient allocation across all courses and activities

## Background
The secretary UI design includes sophisticated venue booking and resource management features. This story captures the need for an intelligent system that goes beyond basic booking to provide dynamic optimization and conflict resolution for institutional resources.

## Acceptance Criteria
