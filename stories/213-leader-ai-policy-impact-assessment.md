# Story 213: Leader AI-Powered Policy Impact Assessment System

## Title
Leader AI-Powered Policy Impact Assessment for Predictive Decision Making

## Story
As a leader, I want an AI-powered policy impact assessment system so that I can analyze the potential effects of proposed policies before implementation, predict outcomes using institutional data, and make informed decisions with confidence about policy changes and their implications.

## Background
Leaders need sophisticated tools to evaluate policy proposals before implementation, understanding potential impacts on various stakeholders, resource requirements, and institutional objectives through data-driven predictive modeling.

- [ ] AI-powered predictive modeling for policy outcome forecasting
- [ ] Scenario simulation with multiple implementation strategies and timelines
- [ ] Stakeholder impact analysis with quantified effects on different user groups
- [ ] Resource requirement prediction including budget, personnel, and time estimates
- [ ] Risk assessment with probability distributions and mitigation strategies

### Impact Visualization and Analysis
- [ ] Interactive policy impact dashboards with multi-dimensional analysis views
- [ ] Before/after comparison modeling with trend projection capabilities
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis with ROI calculations and break-even projections
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis showing impact of variable changes on outcomes
- [ ] Integration with institutional performance metrics and KPI tracking

### Evidence-Based Decision Support
- [ ] Historical policy outcome analysis with lessons learned integration
- [ ] Best practice recommendations based on peer institution data
- [ ] Expert opinion integration with weighted consensus modeling
- [ ] Literature review and research evidence compilation and analysis
- [ ] Compliance impact assessment with regulatory requirement checking

### Collaborative Policy Development
- [ ] Multi-stakeholder feedback collection and integration systems
- [ ] Expert panel consultation workflows with structured input gathering
- [ ] Public comment and community input management platforms
