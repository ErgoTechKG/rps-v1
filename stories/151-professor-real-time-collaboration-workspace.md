## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Research Team Collaboration
**Given** a professor is leading a research project with multiple students
**When** they create a collaborative workspace
**Then** all team members can simultaneously edit documents, share resources, and communicate in real-time

### Scenario 2: Virtual Lab Meeting
**Given** a professor needs to conduct a virtual lab meeting
**When** they initiate a video call from the collaboration workspace
**Then** participants can join, share screens, use whiteboard tools, and the meeting is automatically recorded

### Scenario 3: Document Co-authoring
**Given** a professor and students are co-authoring a research paper
**When** multiple users edit the document simultaneously
**Then** changes are synchronized in real-time with clear attribution and no data loss

### Scenario 4: Project Timeline Management
**Given** a complex research project with multiple phases
**When** the professor creates project timelines and task assignments
**Then** all team members can view progress, update task status, and receive notifications about deadlines

### Scenario 5: Cross-Device Synchronization
**Given** a professor switches between desktop and mobile devices
**When** they access the collaboration workspace
**Then** all documents, chat history, and project status are synchronized across devices
