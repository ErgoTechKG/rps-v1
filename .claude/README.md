lease revise @research-platform-ui-design.md (you only need to work on this file).

Then, create four new files, each representing a distinct user role view. Ensure the following:
	•	Each user role has a clearly defined and separate interface.
	•	Shared views are logically organized and consistently structured.
	•	Data visibility respects role boundaries—users should only access what’s appropriate for their role.

Use logical reasoning to define access control and improve clarity in the role-specific UI design.
